      "# Overview\n",
      "Food allergies are a growing food safety and public health concern that affect an estimated 4%-6% of children in the United States. 1,2 Children with food allergies are two to four times more likely to have asthma or other allergic conditions than those without food allergies. 1 The prevalence of food allergies among children increased 18% during 1997-2007, and allergic reactions to foods have become the most common cause of anaphylaxis in community health settings. 1,3 In 2006, about 88% of schools had one or more students with a food allergy. 4 Staff who work in schools and early care and education (ECE) programs should develop plans for how they will respond effectively to children with food allergies.\n",
      "Although the number of children with food allergies in any one school or ECE program may seem small, allergic reactions can be life-threatening and have far-reaching effects on children and their families, as well as on the schools or ECE programs they attend. Any child with a food allergy deserves attention and the school or ECE program should create a plan for preventing an allergic reaction and responding to a food allergy emergency.\n",
      "Studies show that 16%-18% of children with food allergies have had a reaction from accidentally eating food allergens while at school. 5,6 In addition, 25% of the severe and potentially life-threatening reactions (anaphylaxis) reported at schools happened in children with no previous diagnosis of food allergy. 5,7 School and ECE program staff should be ready to address the needs of children with known food allergies. They also should be prepared to respond effectively to the emergency needs of children who are not known to have food allergies but who exhibit allergic signs and symptoms.\n",
      "Until now, no national guidelines had been developed to help schools and ECE programs address the needs of the growing numbers of children with food allergies. However, 14 states and many school districts have formal policies or guidelines to improve the management of food allergies in schools. 8,9 Many schools and ECE programs have implemented some of the steps needed to manage food allergies effectively. 4 Yet systematic planning for managing the risk of food allergies and responding to food allergy emergencies in schools and ECE programs remain incomplete and inconsistent. 10,11\n",
      "\n",
      "# FDA Food Safety Modernization Act\n",
      "These guidelines, Voluntary Guidelines for Managing Food Allergies in Schools and Early Care and Education Programs (hereafter called the Voluntary Guidelines for Managing Food Allergies), were developed in response to Section 112 of the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, which was enacted in 2011. 12 This act is designed to improve food safety in the United States by shifting the focus from response to prevention. Section 112(b) calls for the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, to \"develop guidelines to be used on a voluntary basis to develop plans for individuals to manage the risk of food allergy and anaphylaxis in schools a and early childhood education programs b \" and \"make such guidelines available to local educational agencies, schools, early childhood education programs, and other interested entities and individuals to be implemented on a voluntary basis only. \" 12 Each plan, described in the act to manage the risk of food allergy and anaphylaxis in schools and early childhood education programs, that is developed for an individual shall be considered an education record for the purpose of Section 444 of the General Education Provisions Act (commonly referred to as the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act). The act specifies that nothing in the guidelines developed under its auspices should be construed to preempt state law. (A link to FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, including Section 112 statutory language is provided in Section 6, Resources.) Specifically, the content of these guidelines should address the following:\n",
      "- Parental obligation to provide the school or early childhood education program, prior to the start of every school year, with documentation from their child's physician or nurse supporting a diagnosis of food allergy, and any risk of anaphylaxis, if applicable; identifying any food to which the child is allergic; describing, if appropriate, any prior history of anaphylaxis; listing any medication prescribed for the child for the treatment of anaphylaxis; detailing emergency treatment procedures in the event of a reaction; listing the signs and symptoms of a reaction; assessing the child's readiness for self-administration of prescription medication; and a list of substitute meals that may be offered to the child by school or early childhood education program food service personnel.\n",
      "- The creation and maintenance of an individual plan for food allergy management, in consultation with the parent, tailored to the needs of each child with a documented risk for anaphylaxis, including any procedures for the self-administration of medication by such children in instances where the children are capable of self-administering medication; and such administration is not prohibited by state law.\n",
      "- Communication strategies between individual schools or early childhood education programs and providers of emergency medical services, including appropriate instructions for emergency medical response.\n",
      "- Strategies to reduce the risk of exposure to anaphylactic causative agents in classrooms and common school or early childhood education program areas such as cafeterias.\n",
      "a. The term school is defined in the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FDA FSMA) to include public kindergartens, elementary schools, and secondary schools. 12 b. The term early childhood education program is defined in the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act to include a Head Start program or an Early Head Start program carried out under the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 et seq.), a statelicensed or state-regulated child care program or school, or a state prekindergarten program that serves children from birth through kindergarten. 12 Some of these early childhood education programs may provide early intervention and preschool services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Some programs that provide these IDEA early intervention and preschool services may not fall under the FDA FSMA, but may still wish to consider these voluntary guidelines when developing procedures for children with food allergies.\n",
      "- The dissemination of general information on life threatening food allergies to school or early childhood education program staff, parents, and children.\n",
      "- Food allergy management training of school or early childhood education program personnel who regularly come into contact with children with life-threatening food allergies.\n",
      "- The authorization and training of school or early childhood education program personnel to administer epinephrine when the nurse is not immediately available.\n",
      "- The timely accessibility of epinephrine by school or early childhood education program personnel when the nurse is not immediately available.\n",
      "- The creation of a plan contained in each individual plan for food allergy management that addresses the appropriate response to an incident of anaphylaxis of a child while such child is engaged in extracurricular programs of a school or early childhood education program, such as non-academic outings and field trips, before-and afterschool programs or before-and after-early childhood education programs, and schoolsponsored or early childhood education program-sponsored programs held on weekends.\n",
      "- Maintenance of information for each administration of epinephrine to a child at risk for anaphylaxis and prompt notification to parents.\n",
      "- Other elements determined necessary for the management of food allergies and anaphylaxis in schools and early childhood education programs. 12 Section 1 of the Voluntary Guidelines for Managing Food Allergies addresses these content requirements. Section 2 provides a list of recommended actions for school board members and administrators and staff at the district level. Section 3 provides a list of recommended actions for administrators and staff in schools, while Section 4 provides recommended actions for administrators and staff in ECE programs. Section 5 provides information about relevant federal laws that are enforced or administered by the U.S. Department of Education (ED), the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Section 6 provides a list of resources with more information and strategies.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Methods\n",
      "To develop these guidelines, staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) created a systematic process to collect, review, and compile expert advice, scientific literature, state guidelines, best practice documents, and position statements from individuals, agencies, and organizations.\n",
      "In January 2010, CDC sponsored a meeting of experts to gather their input into the critical processes and actions needed to protect students with food allergies and to respond to food allergy emergencies in schools. This meeting included representatives from the following groups (see Acknowledgements for details):\n",
      "- Federal agencies with expertise in food allergy management in the public health sector, including in schools (CDC, Food and Drug Administration, U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, U.S. Department of Education , U.S. Department of Agriculture ).\n",
      "- Organizations with expertise or experience in clinical food allergy management and food allergy advice to consumers (Food Allergy and Anaphylaxis Network, Food Allergy Initiative, Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American College of Asthma, Allergy, and Immunology).\n",
      "- Organizations representing professionals who work in schools (National School Boards Association, National Education Association, National Association of School Nurses, National Association of School Administrators, National Association of Elementary School Principals, National Association of Secondary School Principals, School Nutrition Association, American School Counseling Association, and the American School Health Association).\n",
      "- One state educational agency.\n",
      "- One local school district.\n",
      "- Two parents of children with food allergies.\n",
      "Meeting participants provided input on the organization and content for food allergy guidelines.\n",
      "In terms of organization, they recommended that the guidelines should:\n",
      "- Use a management framework that is similar to the framework used to address other chronic conditions in schools and ECE programs. This framework should include creation of a building-wide team and essential elements of a plan to manage food allergies.\n",
      "- Make sure that management and support systems address the needs of children with food allergies and promote an allergen-safe c school or ECE program.\n",
      "- Promote partnerships among schools and ECE programs, children with food allergies and their families, and health care providers.\n",
      "c. The term allergen-safe refers to an environment that is made as safe as possible from food allergens. The phrase should not be interpreted to mean an allergen-free environment totally safe from food allergens. There is no failsafe way to prevent an allergen from inadvertently entering a school or ECE program facility. When guarding against exposures to food allergens, a school or ECE program should still properly plan for children with any life-threatening food allergies, to educate all school personnel accordingly, and ensure that school staff are trained and prepared to prevent and respond to a food allergy emergency.\n",
      "- Emphasize the value of an onsite, full-time registered nurse to manage food allergies in children, but provide guidance for schools and ECE programs that don't have a full-time or part-time registered nurse.\n",
      "- Convey scientific evidence and established clinical practice in terms that leaders and staff in schools and ECE programs understand. Make sure this information is consistent with regulatory and planning guidelines from other federal agencies.\n",
      "- Emphasize the need to follow state laws, including regulations (such as Nurse Practice Acts and state food safety regulations) and school or ECE program policies when deciding which procedures and actions are permissible or allowed.\n",
      "In terms of content, meeting participants recommended that the guidelines should:\n",
      "- Recommend that children with food allergies be identified so an individual plan for managing their food allergies can be developed.\n",
      "- Include essential practices for protecting children from allergic reactions and responding to reactions that occur at schools or ECE programs, at sponsored events, or during transport to and from schools or ECE programs.\n",
      "- Develop strategies to reduce the risk of exposure to food allergens in classrooms, cafeterias, and other school or ECE program settings.\n",
      "- Develop steps for responding to food allergy emergencies, including the administration of epinephrine, that are consistent with a school's or ECE program's \"all-hazards\" plan.\n",
      "- Emphasize training for staff to improve their understanding of food allergies, their ability to help children prevent exposure to food allergens, and their ability to respond to food allergy emergencies (including administration of epinephrine). This training can help to create an environment of acceptance and support for children with food allergies.\n",
      "- Emphasize the need to teach children about food allergies as part of the school's or ECE program's health education curriculum.\n",
      "- Address the need to teach all parents about food allergies.\n",
      "- Address the physical safety and emotional needs of children with food allergies (i.e., stigma, bullying, harassment).\n",
      "- Include a list of actions for all staff working in schools and ECE programs that may have a role in managing risk of food allergy, including administrators, registered nurses, teachers, paraprofessional staff, counselors, food service staff, and custodial staff.\n",
      "Meeting participants provided an initial set of data and literature sources for analysis. CDC staff then reviewed published literature from peer-reviewed and nonpeer-reviewed sources, including descriptive studies, epidemiologic studies, expert statements, policy statements, and relevant Web-based content from federal agencies. CDC scientists conducted an extensive search for scientific reports, using four electronic citation databases: PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, and ERIC. To ensure a comprehensive review of food allergy sources, CDC used search terms that included a combination of terms, such as \"food allergy, \" \"school, \" \"anaphylaxis, \" \"epinephrine, \" \"peanut allergy, \" \"child, \" \"pediatric, \" \"food allergy and bullying, \" \"emergencies, \" \"life-threatening allergy, \" \"school nurse, \" and \"food allergy and child care. \" CDC staff reviewed all recommended documents and eliminated sources that were outdated (earlier than 2000), were superseded by more current data or recommendations, in conflict with current standards of clinical and school-based practice, reflected international recommendations not relevant to U.S. schools or ECE programs, or were limited to adult food allergies.\n",
      "CDC staff relied heavily on the content and references in the 2010 Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Food Allergy in the United States. 13 These 2010 guidelines reflect the most up-to-date, extensive systematic review of the literature and assessment of the body of evidence on the science of food allergies. They met the standards of rigorous systematic search and review methods, and they provide clear recommendations that are based on consensus among researchers, scientists, clinical practitioners, and the public. While the 2010 guidelines did not address the management of patients with food allergies outside of clinical settings (and thus did not directly address the management of food allergies in schools), they were deemed an important source for informing the clinical practice recommendations for managing risks for children with food allergies in the Voluntary Guidelines for Managing Food Allergies.\n",
      "To ensure that recommendations for managing the risk of food allergies were consistent with those recommended for other chronic conditions, CDC staff added search terms that included \"school\" and \"asthma, \"\"diabetes, \"\"epilepsy, \"\"chronic condition, \" and \"management. \" In particular, they used information from the following three documents: Students with Chronic Illness: Guidance for Families, Schools, and Students, 14 Managing Asthma: A Guide for Schools, 15 and Helping the Student with Diabetes Succeed: A Guide for School Personnel. 16 CDC staff analyzed best practice documents, state school food allergy guidelines (n = 14), and relevant health and education organizations' position statements for compatibility with the priorities outlined by experts, common themes, and the accuracy and clarity of recommendations or positions based on clinical standards and scientific evidence.\n",
      "To ensure that these Voluntary Guidelines for Managing Food Allergies were compatible with existing federal laws, federal regulations, and current guidelines for schools and ECE programs, CDC solicited expertise and input from the following sources:\n",
      "- Office of the General Counsel; Office of Safe and Healthy Students, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education; Office for Civil Rights; and Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services, U.S. Department of Education (ED).\n",
      "- Civil Rights Division, U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).\n",
      "- Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Early Childhood, Administration for Children and Families, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).\n",
      "In addition to the input from the experts meeting, the analysis of research and practice documents, and the technical advice and assistance provided by regulatory federal agencies, CDC conducted three formal rounds of expert review and comment. During the first round, CDC staff worked with meeting participants and agency partners to get concurrence with recommendations. Second and third round reviews were used to refine the content. Reviewers included participants from the first meeting and additional reviewers added after each round to ensure input from at least one new person who had not previously reviewed the document. In addition to these formal reviews, CDC staff asked for multiple reviews from select experts in food allergy management, schools, and ECE programs to ensure the accuracy of the information and relevance of the recommendations to professional practice. During the review process, CDC staff reviewed and accepted additional references that supported changes made in draft recommendations.\n",
      "The resulting Voluntary Guidelines for Managing Food Allergies include recommendations for practice in the following five priority areas that should be addressed in each school's or ECE program's Food Allergy Management Prevention Plan:\n",

      "# Purpose\n",
      "The Voluntary Guidelines for Managing Food Allergies are intended to support implementation of food allergy management and prevention plans and practices in schools and ECE programs. They provide practical information, planning steps, and strategies for reducing allergic reactions and responding to life-threatening reactions for parents, district administrators, school administrators and staff, and ECE program administrators and staff. They can guide improvements in existing food allergy management plans and practices. They can help schools and ECE programs develop a plan where none currently exists. Schools and ECE programs will not need to change their organization or structure or incorporate burdensome practices to respond effectively. They also should not have to incur significant financial costs where basic health and emergency services are already provided.\n",
      "Although the practices in these guidelines are voluntary, any actions taken for individual children must be implemented consistent with applicable federal and state laws and local policies. Many of the practices reinforce relevant federal laws and regulations administered or enforced by ED, HHS, DOJ, and USDA. How these laws apply case by case will depend upon the facts in each situation. These guidelines also do not address state and local laws or local school district policies because the requirements of these laws and policies vary from state to state and from school district to school district. References to state guidelines reflect support for and consistency with the recommendations in the Voluntary Food Allergy Guidelines, but do not suggest federal endorsement of state guidelines. While these guidelines provide information related to certain applicable laws, they should not be construed as giving legal advice. Schools and ECE programs should consult local legal professionals for such advice. Although schools and ECE programs have some common characteristics, they operate under different laws and regulations and serve children with different developmental and supervisory needs. Different practices are needed in each setting to manage the risk of food allergies. These guidelines include recommendations that apply to both settings, and they identify how the recommendations should be applied differently in each setting when appropriate. These guidelines do not provide specific guidance for unlicensed child care settings, although many recommendations can be used in these settings.\n",
      "If a school or ECE program participates in the Child Nutrition Programs (CNPs), then USDA Food and Nutrition Service is the federal agency with oversight of the meals served. The CNPs include the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs, the Special Milk Program, the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program, the Child and Adult Care Food Program, and the Summer Food Service Program. Schools, institutions, and sites participating in the CNPs are required under relevant statutes to make accommodations to program meals for children that are determined to have a food allergy disability.\n",
      "A food related disability can be a food allergy if the allergy is acknowledged to be a disability by a licensed doctor. These guidelines can assist CNP program operators in providing safe meals and a safe environment for this population of children.\n",

      "# About Food Allergies\n",
      "A food allergy is defined as an adverse health effect arising from a specific immune response that occurs reproducibly on exposure to a given food. 13 The immune response can be severe and life-threatening. Although the immune system normally protects people from germs, in people with food allergies, the immune system mistakenly responds to food as if it were harmful. One way that the immune system causes food allergies is by making a protein antibody called immunoglobulin E (IgE) to the food. The substance in foods that cause this reaction is called the food allergen. When exposed to the food allergen, the IgE antibodies alert cells to release powerful substances, such as histamine, that cause symptoms that can affect the respiratory system, gastrointestinal tract, skin, or cardiovascular system and lead to a lifethreatening reaction called anaphylaxis. 17 The Voluntary Guidelines for Managing Food Allergies focuses not on all food allergies but on food allergies associated with IgE because those are the food allergies that are associated with the risk of anaphylaxis.\n",
      "There are other types of food-related conditions and diseases that range from the frequent problem of digesting lactose in milk, resulting in gas, bloating, and diarrhea, to reactions caused by cereal grains (celiac disease) that can result in severe malabsorption and a variety of other serious health problems. These conditions and diseases may be serious but are not immediately life-threatening and are not addressed in these guidelines. 13, More than 170 foods are known to cause IgE mediated food allergies. In the United States, the following eight foods or food groups account for 90% of serious allergic reactions: milk, eggs, fish, crustacean shellfish, wheat, soy, peanuts, and tree nuts. 13 Federal law requires food labels in the United States to clearly identify the food allergen source of all foods and ingredients that are (or contain any protein derived from) these common allergens. 20 Some nonfood products used in schools and ECE programssuch as clay, paste, or finger paints-can also contain allergens that may or may not be identified as ingredients on product labels. 21 The symptoms of allergic reactions to food vary both in type and severity among individuals and even in one individual over time. Symptoms associated with an allergic reaction to food include the following:\n",
      "- Mucous Membrane Symptoms: red watery eyes or swollen lips, tongue, or eyes.\n",
      "- Skin Symptoms: itchiness, flushing, rash, or hives.\n",
      "- Gastrointestinal Symptoms: nausea, pain, cramping, vomiting, diarrhea, or acid reflux.\n",
      "- Upper Respiratory Symptoms: nasal congestion, sneezing, hoarse voice, trouble swallowing, dry staccato cough, or numbness around mouth.\n",
      "- Lower Respiratory Symptoms: deep cough, wheezing, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, or chest tightness.\n",
      "- Cardiovascular Symptoms: pale or blue skin color, weak pulse, dizziness or fainting, confusion or shock, hypotension (decrease in blood pressure), or loss of consciousness.\n",
      "- Mental or Emotional Symptoms: sense of \"impending doom, \" irritability, change in alertness, mood change, or confusion.\n",

      "# Food Allergy Symptoms in Children\n",
      "Children with food allergies might communicate their symptoms in the following ways:\n",
      "- It feels like something is poking my tongue.\n",
      "- My tongue (or mouth) is tingling (or burning).\n",
      "- My tongue (or mouth) itches.\n",
      "- My tongue feels like there is hair on it.\n",
      "- My mouth feels funny.\n",
      "- There's a frog in my throat; there's something stuck in my throat.\n",
      "- My tongue feels full (or heavy).\n",
      "- My lips feel tight.\n",
      "- It feels like there are bugs in there (to describe itchy ears).\n",
      "- It (my throat) feels thick.\n",
      "- It feels like a bump is on the back of my tongue (throat).\n",
      "Source: The Food Allergy & Anaphylaxis Network. Food Allergy News. 2003;13 (2).\n",
      "Children sometimes do not exhibit overt and visible symptoms after ingesting an allergen, making early diagnosis difficult. 13,22 Some children may not be able to communicate their symptoms clearly because of their age or developmental challenges. Complaints such as abdominal pain, itchiness, or other discomforts may be the first signs of an allergic reaction (see Food Allergy Symptoms in Children).\n",
      "Signs and symptoms can become evident within a few minutes or up to 1-2 hours after ingestion of the allergen, and rarely, several hours after ingestion. Symptoms of breathing difficulty, voice hoarseness, or faintness associated with change in mood or alertness or rapid progression of symptoms that involve a combination of the skin, gastrointestinal tract, or cardiovascular symptoms signal a more severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) and require immediate attention.\n",
      "The severity of reactions to food allergens is difficult to predict and varies depending on the child's particular sensitivity to the food and on the type and amount of exposure to the food. Ingesting a food allergen triggers most severe reactions, while inhaling or having skin contact with food allergens generally causes mild reactions. 23,24,25 The severity of reaction from food ingestion also can be influenced by the child's age, how quickly the allergen is absorbed (e.g., absorption is faster if food is taken on an empty stomach or ingestion is associated with exercise), and by co-existing health conditions or factors. 17 For example, a person with asthma might be at greater risk of having a more severe anaphylactic reaction. Exercise and certain medications also can increase the harmful effects of certain food allergens. 13,26,27\n",
      "\n",
      "# Allergic Reactions and Anaphylaxis\n",
      "Anaphylaxis is best described as a severe allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. 31 Not all allergic reactions will develop\n",
      "\n",
      "# Food Allergies and Asthma\n",
      "One-third of children with food allergies also have asthma, which increases their risk of experiencing a severe or fatal reaction. 28 Data also suggest that children with asthma and food allergies have more visits to hospitals and emergency departments than children who don't have asthma. 2,29,30 Because asthma can pose serious risks to the health of children with food allergies, schools and ECE programs must consider these risks when they develop plans for managing food allergies.\n",
      "into anaphylaxis. In fact, most are mild and resolve without problems. However, early signs of anaphylaxis can resemble a mild allergic reaction. Unless obvious symptoms-such as throat hoarseness or swelling, persistent wheezing, or fainting or low blood pressure-are present, it is not easy to predict whether these initial, mild symptoms will progress to become an anaphylactic reaction that can result in death. 13 Therefore, all children with known or suspected ingestion of a food allergen and the appearance of symptoms consistent with an allergic reaction must be closely monitored and possibly treated for early signs of anaphylaxis.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Characteristics and Risk Factors\n",
      "Food allergies account for 35%-50% of all cases of anaphylaxis in emergency care settings .32 Many different food allergens (e.g., milk, egg, fish, shellfish) can cause anaphylaxis.\n",
      "In the United States, fatal or near fatal reactions are most often caused by peanuts (50%-62%) and tree nuts (15%-30%). 33 Results of studies of fatal allergic reactions to food found that a delay in administering epinephrine was one of the most significant risk factors associated with fatal outcomes. 13,26 Some population groups, including children with a history of anaphylaxis, are at higher risk of having a severe reaction to food (see Fatal Food Allergy Reactions).\n",
      "\n",
      "# Fatal Food Allergy Reactions\n",
      "\n",
      "# Risk Factors\n",
      "- Delayed administration of epinephrine.\n",
      "- Reliance on oral antihistamines alone to treat symptoms.\n",
      "- Consuming alcohol and the food allergen at the same time.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Groups at Higher Risk\n",
      "- Adolescents and young adults.\n",
      "- Children with a known food allergy.\n",
      "- Children with a prior history of anaphylaxis.\n",
      "- Children with asthma, particularly those with poorly controlled asthma.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Timing of Symptoms\n",
      "In general, anaphylaxis caused by a food allergen occurs within minutes to several hours after food ingestion . 13 Death due to food-induced anaphylaxis may occur within 30 minutes to 2 hours of exposure, usually from cardiorespiratory compromise. 13 By the time symptoms of an allergic reaction are recognized, a child is likely to already be experiencing anaphylaxis. Symptoms of anaphylaxis can begin with mild skin symptoms (e.g., hives, flushing) that progress slowly, appear rapidly with more severe symptoms, or appear (in rare circumstances) with shock in the absence of other symptoms. In fact, many fatal anaphylaxis cases caused by food do not follow a predictable pattern that starts with mild skin symptoms.\n",
      "Even if initial symptoms are successfully treated or resolve completely, up to 20% of anaphylactic reactions recur within 4-8 hours (called biphasic reaction). In other cases, symptoms do not completely resolve and require additional emergency care. For these reasons, children with food-induced anaphylaxis must be monitored closely and evaluated as soon as possible in an emergency care setting.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Treatment of Anaphylaxis and Use of Epinephrine\n",
      "No treatment exists to prevent reactions to food allergies or anaphylaxis. Strict avoidance of the food allergen\n",
      "\n",
      "# Allergens that May Result\n",
      "is the only way to prevent a reaction. However, avoidance in Anaphylaxis that Require Use is not always easy or possible, and staff in schools and ECE of Epinephrine programs must be prepared to deal with allergic reactions,\n",
      "- Foods such as peanuts, tree nuts, including anaphylaxis. Early and quick recognition and milk, eggs, fish, or shellfish. treatment of allergic reactions that may lead to anaphylaxis can prevent serious health problems or death.\n",
      "- Medications such as penicillin or aspirin. The recommended first line of treatment for anaphylaxis is the prompt use of epinephrine. Early use of epinephrine\n",
      "- Bee venom or insect stings, such to treat anaphylaxis improves a person's chance of survival as from yellow jackets, wasps, and quick recovery. 13,34 hornets, or fire ant).\n",
      "Epinephrine, also called adrenaline, is naturally produced - Latex, such as from gloves. by the body. When given by injection, it rapidly improves breathing, increases heart rate, and reduces swelling of the face, lips, and throat. Epinephrine is typically available in the form of an autoinjector, a spring loaded syringe used to deliver a measured dose of epinephrine, designed for self-administration by patients, or administration by persons untrained in other needle-based forms of epinephrine delivery. In a clinical setting, patients may receive epinephrine through other needle-based delivery methods.\n",
      "Epinephrine can quickly improve a person's symptoms, but the effects are not long lasting. If symptoms recur (biphasic reaction), additional doses of epinephrine are needed. Even when epinephrine is used, 911 or other emergency medical services (EMS) must be called so the person can be transported quickly in an emergency vehicle to the nearest hospital emergency department for further medical treatment and observation. 13 It is not possible to set one guideline for when to use epinephrine to treat allergic reactions caused by food. A person needs clinical experience and judgment to recognize the symptoms associated with anaphylaxis, and not all school or ECE program staff have this experience. Clinical guidelines for how to manage food-induced allergic reactions have mainly focused on the health care setting. They emphasize the need to watch patients closely and give the proper treatment, including epinephrine.\n",
      "Treatment decisions are based on the progression or increased severity of symptoms and whether the patient has a history of risk factors for anaphylaxis (see Fatal Food Allergy Reactions). 13 For example, the clinical guidelines favor quick and early use of epinephrine as soon as even mild symptoms appear for children who have had severe allergic reactions in the past. Some schools and ECE programs offer clinical services from a doctor or registered nurse. In these cases, the doctor or nurse can use the clinical guidelines to assess children and make decisions about treatment, including if or when to use epinephrine. However, many schools and most ECE programs do not have a doctor or nurse onsite to make such an assessment. In these cases, a staff person at the scene should call 911 or EMS immediately. If staff are trained to recognize symptoms of an allergic reaction or anaphylaxis and are delegated and trained to administer epinephrine, they also should administer epinephrine by auto-injector at the first signs of an allergic reaction, especially if the child's breathing changes. In addition, school or ECE program staff should make sure that the child is transported without delay in an emergency vehicle to the nearest hospital emergency department for further medical treatment and observation. 24,35 These actions may result in administering epinephrine and activating emergency response systems for a child whose allergic reaction does not progress to life-threatening anaphylaxis. However, the delay or failure to administer epinephrine and the lack of medical attention have contributed to many fatal anaphylaxis cases from food allergies. 25, The risk of death from untreated anaphylaxis outweighs the risk of adverse side effects from using epinephrine in these cases.\n",

      "# Emotional Impact on Children with Food Allergies and Their Parents d\n",
      "The health of a child with a food allergy can be compromised at any time by an allergic reaction to food that is severe or life threatening. Many studies have shown that food allergies have a significant effect on the psychosocial well-being of children with food allergies and their families.  Parents of a child with a food allergy may have constant fear about the possibility of a life-threatening reaction and stress from constant vigilance needed to prevent a reaction. They also have to trust their child to the care of others, make sure their child is safe outside the home, and help their child have a normal sense of identity.\n",
      "Children with food allergies may also have constant fear and stress about the possibility of a lifethreatening reaction. The fear of ingesting a food allergen without knowing it can lead to coping strategies that limit social and other daily activities. Children can carry emotional burdens because they are not accepted by other people, they are socially isolated, or they believe they are a burden to others. They also may have anxiety and distress that is caused by teasing, taunting, harassment, or bullying by peers, teachers, or other adults. School and ECE program staff must consider these factors as they develop plans for managing the risk of food allergy for children with food allergies. d. For the purposes of this document, the word parent is used to refer to the adult primary caregiver(s) of a child's basic needs (e.g., feeding, safety). This includes biological parents; other biological relatives such as grandparents, aunts, uncles, or siblings; and non-biological parents such as adoptive, foster, or stepparents.\n",

      "# Allergist or Other Doctor\n",
      "The collective knowledge and experience of a licensed doctor, children with food allergies, and their families can guide the most effective management of food allergies in schools or ECE programs for each child. Close working relationships can help ease anxiety among parents, build trust, and improve the knowledge and skill of school or ECE program staff members. 10,14,42 In schools, all staff members play a part in protecting the health and safety of children with chronic conditions. These staff members include administrators, school nurses or school doctors, food service staff (including food service contract staff ), classroom and specialty teachers, athletic coaches, school counselors, bus drivers, custodial and maintenance staff, therapists, paraeducators, special education service providers, librarians and media specialists, security staff, substitute teachers, and volunteers, such as playground monitors and field trip chaperones. In ECE programs, staff members include the center director, health consultants, nutrition and food service staff, Head Start and child care providers, preschool teachers, teaching assistants, aides, volunteers, and transportation staff.\n",
      "A team structure allows for collective management of food allergies, with coordinated planning and communication to ensure that staff responsibilities are carried out in a clear and consistent manner. Instead of creating a new team to address the food allergy-related needs of a particular student with a food allergy, schools and ECE programs can use an existing team such as the student's Section 504 committee (which addresses Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973), the student's Individualized Education Program (IEP) team , the school improvement team, child and learning support team, school health or wellness team, or Head Start Health Services Advisory Committee.\n",
      "Involving the school doctor (if applicable), an allergist in the community, or the child's doctor can help the school or ECE program reduce the risk of accidental exposure to allergens. 47 A doctor's diagnosis of a food allergy is necessary to accurately inform plans for avoiding food allergens and managing allergic reactions. The doctor can also give advice on the best practices to control or manage food allergies. 24,25 An allergist is a licensed doctor with specialty training in the diagnosis and treatment of allergic diseases, asthma, and diseases of the immune system.\n",
      "Children with food allergies and their parents have firsthand experience with allergic reactions and are most familiar with a child's unique signs and symptoms. Parents should give the school or ECE program documentation that supports a doctor's diagnosis of food allergy, as well as information about prior history and current risk of anaphylaxis. This information is critical to preventing risk of exposure to allergens and outlining the actions that must be taken if a food allergen exposure occurs. Parents should be continually involved in helping to build a learning environment that is responsive to their child's unique health condition. 47 By working together, parents and school or ECE program staff can communicate better and make sure they have the same expectations. This partnership also shows a shared commitment to the child's well-being and builds parental support and confidence in the ability of school or ECE program staff to manage food allergies.\n",
      "Many parents give their ECE program an Emergency Care Plan (ECP) developed by the child's allergist or other doctor. This plan may be the only information ECE program staff members have to manage the child's food allergy. When multiple children have food allergies, the result can be multiple approaches for addressing and managing food allergies and reactions. Instead, ECE programs should use a coordinated approach that is built on partnerships among ECE program staff, parents, and doctors. With a coordinated approach, staff can create one consistent plan of action for responding to any child with a food allergy and to any allergic reaction. 10,44,48\n",
      "\n",
      "# Provide clear leadership to guide planning and ensure implementation of food allergy management plans and practices.\n",
      "Successful coordination of food allergy planning requires strong school and ECE program leadership. The support of school principals and ECE program administrators is critical, but it may make more sense for the person who provides or coordinates health services for children to lead the food allergy planning process. 49,50 For example, most schools and some ECE programs have a school or district nurse, school doctor, or health consultant or manager. Nationwide, about 85% of schools have either a part-time or full-time nurse to provide health services to students (37% have a full-time nurse). 8 In Head Start programs, health services must be supervised by staff members or consultants with training in health-related fields. 50,51 School nurses, school doctors, and health consultants or managers should have the expertise to help schools and ECE programs develop plans to manage food allergies. Specifically, these staff members can:\n",
      "- Work with families and doctors to obtain or create an Emergency Care Plan (ECP) for children with food allergies.\n",
      "- Make sure that each child's plan for managing food allergies is consistent with federal laws and regulations, state laws, including regulations, local policies, and standards of professional practices.\n",
      "- Act as a liaison between school and district policy makers, ECE program administrators, health services staff members, food service staff members, community health service providers, and emergency responders.\n",
      "- Make sure that education records that include personally-identifiable information about a student's food allergy are generally not disclosed without the prior written consent of the parent (or eligible student) in compliance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), 20 U.S.C. 1232g and its implementing regulations in 34 CFR part 99, and any other applicable federal and state laws that protect the privacy or confidentiality of student information. (FERPA may not require parental consent in all circumstances.) FERPA also includes an emergency exception to the prior consent requirement if there is an articulable and significant threat to the health or safety of the student or others. (See Section 5 for more information about FERPA.)\n",
      "- Monitor the use of medication in the school or ECE program setting.\n",
      "- Obtain an epinephrine auto-injector and make sure it is rapidly available to designated and trained staff members to respond to a child's food allergy emergency.\n",
      "- Recognize and handle medical emergencies.\n",
      "- Learn about best practices for managing food allergies.\n",
      "- Help schools and ECE programs develop a comprehensive approach to managing food allergies. Coordinate a team to put the resulting plan into action.\n",
      "- Work with food service staff on parts of the plan that involve meal and snack preparation and services.\n",
      "- Identify internal resources and community partners that can support the planning process.\n",
      "- Share general information about food allergies with staff members, parents, and others who need it.\n",
      "- Make sure staff receive the training they need, including how to administer an epinephrine auto-injector. A doctor or registered nurse can provide this training.\n",
      "- Talk with staff members, doctors, children, and their families about food allergies and how they should be managed. Share concerns from parents and children with the food allergy management team.\n",
      "- Review the school or ECE program plan on a regular basis to look for ways to reduce exposure to food allergens and better manage allergic reactions. Recommend changes when needed to make the plans better. 49,50,52 The many responsibilities outlined in this section demonstrate the benefit of having a full-or parttime registered nurse (and a doctor part-time) and ECE programs having a medically trained and knowledgeable health consultant or manager. However, if a registered nurse, doctor, or health consultant or manager is not available, the school or ECE program administrator can develop a comprehensive plan that may include delegating some critical responsibilities to other trained professional staff. This plan should also include seeking advice from the child's primary doctor or allergist and training guidance and assistance from health services staff at the district level 47 (See Sections 2 and 3.)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Develop and implement a comprehensive plan for managing food allergies.\n",
      "To effectively manage food allergies and the risks associated with these conditions, many people inside and outside the school or ECE program must come together to develop a comprehensive plan, called the Food Allergy Management and Prevention Plan (FAMPP). This plan should include all strategies and actions needed to manage food allergies in the school or ECE program. It also should be compatible with the approach used to address other chronic conditions in each individual setting. 14 The FAMPP should reinforce the efforts of each school or ECE program to create a safe learning environment for all children. It should address systemwide planning, implementation, and follow-up and include specific actions for each individual child with a food allergy. The FAMPP should:\n",
      "- Meet the requirements of federal laws and regulations, such as Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act, if applicable. An explanation of how these federal laws could apply to students with food allergies is provided in Section 5. Among other things, these federal laws address individualized assessment of each child's needs and parental participation in the development of any plan or program designed to meet these dietary needs. An effective FAMPP also would need to meet the requirements of state and local laws and regulations and district policies.\n",
      "- Reflect clear goals, purposes, and expectations for food allergy management that are consistent with the school's or ECE program's mission and policies.\n",
      "- Be clear and easy to understand and implement.\n",
      "- Be responsive to the needs of any child with food allergies by taking into account the different and unique needs of each child.\n",
      "- Be adaptable and updated regularly on the basis of experiences, best practices, current research, and changes in district policy or state or county law.\n",
      "The FAMPP should address the following five priorities:\n",
      "1. Ensure the daily management of food allergies for individual children.\n",
      "2. Prepare for food allergy emergencies.\n",
      "3. Provide professional development on food allergies for staff members.\n",

      "# Ensure the daily management of food allergies for individual children.\n",
      "To protect the health and safety of an individual child with food allergies, school and ECE program staff must identify children with a history of food allergies and develop or obtain plans to manage their allergies.\n",
      "a. Identify children with food allergies.\n",
      "Schools and ECE programs usually have forms and procedures to identify children with chronic conditions, including food allergies, when they enroll or transfer to the school-or when the condition is not initially reported but becomes evident during the academic year. Examples include health condition forms or parent interviews.\n",
      "Children or parents may report a food allergy on the required forms, but this information may not be accurate or complete. Schools and ECE program staff must work with parents to obtain, directly from the child's healthcare provider, the medical information necessary to develop plans for managing the individual care and emergency actions.\n",
      "The USDA requires a doctor's statement that a child has a food allergy disability before food service staff in the Child Nutrition Program can make meal accommodations and provide a safe meal for a child with a food allergy.\n",
      "\n",
      "# b. Develop a plan to manage and reduce the risk of food allergy reactions in individual children.\n",
      "Parents and doctors should provide information and recommendations to help schools and ECE programs develop written plans to manage food allergies for children on a daily basis. This information may be provided on health condition forms, medical orders, doctor's statement, or diet orders. There are a variety of names used to label written plans for individual children with food allergies. It is essential for children to have a short, easy to follow plan for emergency care. This is usually a food allergy Emergency Care Plan (ECP). Other names used for the ECP can include a \"food allergy action plan, \"\"emergency action plan, \" or in ECE programs, an \"individual care plan\". Schools or ECE programs may need to establish additional plans, such as a Section 504 plan or, if appropriate, an Individualized Education Program (IEP), or may establish a nursing assessment and outcome-type Individualized Health Plan (IHP).\n",
      "The ECP is the basic form used to collect food allergy information and it should be completed for every child identified as having a food allergy. 24,25,48, (If an ECP form is used by the Child Nutrition Program staff to make meal accommodations, it should include the medical information required by the USDA and must be signed by the doctor). This form should be kept in each child's school health record, and it may include the following:\n",
      "Â°Â°A recent photo of the child.\n",
      "Â°Â°Information about the food allergen, including a confirmed written diagnosis from the child's doctor or allergist.\n",

      "Â°Â°A treatment plan for responding to a food allergy reaction or emergency, including whether an epinephrine auto-injector should be used.\n",
      "Â°Â°Information about other conditions, such as asthma or exercise-induced anaphylaxis that might affect food allergy management.\n",
      "Â°Â°Contact information for parents and doctors, including alternate phone numbers for notification in case of emergency.\n",
      "The ECP should be written by the child's doctor and confirmed with the parents. In some cases, it can be written by a registered nurse, or school doctor, as long as the child's doctor is consulted and the parents confirm the plan. The child's doctor and parents should sign and date the ECP, and schools and ECE programs should not accept a child's ECP without confirmation and signature from the child's doctor. If a public elementary or secondary school maintains an ECP on an individual child, the ECP would be covered by FERPA as an \"education record. \" The ECP should specifically state who may have access to the information in the plan, and should ensure that any such access to this information is permissible under FERPA and any other applicable federal or state laws that protect the privacy or confidentiality of student information. (See Section 5 for more information about FERPA.) Section 6 lists state and organizational resources that include examples of ECPs and suggested processes that schools and ECE programs might use to develop their ECPs.\n",
      "An IHP is a written document that outlines how children will receive health care services at school and is developed and used by a registered nurse. The IHP documents a specific student's health needs and outlines specific health outcome expectations and plans for achieving these expectations. The use of an IHP is standard practice for schools with a full-time or part-time registered nurse and it is commonly used to document the progress of children with an identified chronic condition such as food allergies. 39,47,52,61 The IHP helps registered nurses manage the risk of food allergies, prevent allergic reactions, and coordinate care with other staff (such as food service staff ) and health service providers outside the school. Federal law does not require the use of an IHP, but its contents can be useful to the nurse in addressing the requirements of federal laws related to school responsibilities for children with food allergies. Section 6 lists state and organizational resources that include examples of an IHP.\n",
      "If a doctor determines that a child's food allergy may result in anaphylaxis and if the child's food allergy constitutes a disability under applicable federal disability laws, school staff can integrate information from the ECP, doctor's statement, and IHP into a Section 504 plan or, if appropriate, into an IEP. (See Section 5 for more information on applicable federal laws.) Schools should still use an ECP with specific, easy-to-read information about how to respond to a food allergy reaction.\n",
      "For children that are identified as having a food allergy disability and who attend a school or ECE program that participates in the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA's) Child Nutrition Programs, a meal or food substitution or modification must be made when the diagnosis is supported by a doctors' signed statement. Before Child Nutrition Program food service staff can provide a safe meal accommodation, parents must provide a statement from a licensed doctor that identifies: Â°Â°The child's disability (according to pertinent statutes).\n",
      "Â°Â°An explanation of why the disability restricts the child's diet.\n",
      "Â°Â°The major life activity affected by the disability.\n",
      "Â°Â°The food or foods to be omitted from the child's diet.\n",
      "Â°Â°The food or choice of foods that must be substituted. 62 A child recognized by the Child Nutrition Program staff as having a food allergy disability does not have to have a Section 504 plan, ECP, IHP, or IEP in order for a meal accommodation to be provided.\n",
      "A statement signed by a licensed doctor addressing the points above is sufficient. However, the Child Nutrition Program-required doctor's statement can be integrated in any plan a school or ECE develops to meet a child's special dietary needs.\n",
      "If a Section 504 plan or, if appropriate, an IEP, is developed in connection with the provision of services required under those laws to address the student's food allergy disability, information from the ECP is still useful and can be referenced in, or incorporated into, the Section 504 Plan or IEP. Note that a Section 504 plan or IEP is an education record subject to FERPA. For children not covered by Federal disability laws, schools can use the ECP and IHP to manage each child's food allergy. The IHP can include information about modifications and substitutions for meal and snack planning. An IHP or ECP developed for an individual student is also an education record subject to FERPA.\n",
      "In ECE programs, every child with a food allergy should have an ECP or individual care plan, even if the child has a Section 504 plan or, if eligible for services under IDEA, has an IEP or, if appropriate, an individualized family service plan (IFSP). (See Section 5 for more information regarding these Federal laws.) Because most ECE programs do not have a registered nurse on staff to develop such a plan, the ECE program's health consultant, health manager, or administrator should review each child's health records and emergency information at enrollment and work with parents to obtain an ECP for each child diagnosed with a food allergy. The ECP should be updated at least once a year. Health consultants or managers can share information about any allergic reactions, changes in the child's health status, and exposure to allergens with parents and doctors (with the parents' permission). Working with parents and the child's healthcare provider is essential to make sure that children get the medical services and accommodations they need. Staff should consider referring children without access to health care to health services, when possible.\n",
      "ECPs used by ECE programs should be signed and dated by the child's doctor and parents. The plan should specifically state who has access to the plan. The plan also should state which staff members are responsible for the care, transportation, and feeding of children with food allergies. 12,50 (See Section 5 for more information about applicable Federal laws.) c. Help students manage their own food allergies.\n",
      "Young children in ECE programs and early elementary grades in schools generally cannot manage their own food allergies. However, some students, especially adolescents, can take responsibility for managing their own food allergies, including carrying and using epinephrine when needed. When medication is required by students who have chronic health conditions, especially when medication may be lifesaving, it is best practice to encourage and assist students to become educated and competent in their own care. 48,54,63,64 Students who can manage their own food allergies should have quick (within a few minutes) access to an epinephrine auto-injector, both at school and during school-related events. 13 Some schools allow students to carry prescribed epinephrine auto-injectors (e.g., in their pocket, backpack, or purse) at school. Some state laws, allow students to carry auto-injectors during activities on school property and during transportation to and from school or school-related events. 63 Federal law requires reasonable modifications of school policies when necessary to avoid disability discrimination, and in some cases, this may require allowing a student to carry an epinephrine auto-injector. School officials should check state and federal laws before setting their policies and practices. See Section 5 for more information about applicable Federal laws.\n",
      "Before students are allowed to carry and use medication, school staff should assess students' knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and skills to determine their ability to handle this responsibility. 64 This decision should be reassessed periodically, and the school nurse or another assigned staff member should randomly check to make sure students are carrying their epinephrine auto-injector. Some students with food allergies may choose to wear medical alert bracelets, which can aid emergency response. 13 School officials can encourage students to wear these bracelets, but they should not require them. Some students will not want to wear such jewelry because they fear being stigmatized.\n",
      "School nurses and other school staff members should reinforce self-management skills for students with food allergies. These skills include reading labels, asking questions about foods in the school meal and snack programs, avoiding unlabeled or unknown foods, using epinephrine auto-injectors when needed, and recognizing and reporting an allergic reaction to an adult.\n",
      "Even when students are able to manage their own food allergies, school staff need to know which students have allergies so they can have plans in place to monitor each student's condition and be able to respond in an emergency. Because some symptoms of anaphylaxis may continue after a dose of epinephrine is administered and because students might not always have their medication with them, schools should also keep a second epinephrine auto-injector (provided by parent or student) in a secure but rapidly accessible location. 63,65,66 (See the textbox on page 31 related to the justification for more than one dose of epinephrine.)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Prepare for food allergy emergencies.\n",
      "All schools and ECE programs should anticipate and prepare for food allergy emergencies in the same ways they approach emergency preparedness for other hazards. Comprehensive emergency planning includes prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery for any type of emergency. This \"all-hazards\" model is often used to plan for natural disasters, weather-related emergencies, and pandemic influenza. A school's all-hazards emergency plan also should address potential crises caused by violence or food allergy emergencies. 67 This plan should go beyond each child's ECP to include building-level planning, communication, training, and emergency response procedures. 68 a. Set up communication systems that are easy to use.\n",
      "Communication devices, such as intercoms, walkie-talkies, or cell phones, should be available at all times in case of an emergency. School and ECE program staff in classrooms, gymnasiums, cafeterias, playgrounds, and transportation vehicles should be able to communicate easily and quickly with the school nurse, school authorities, health consultants or managers, emergency responders and parents. Communication devices should be checked regularly to make sure they work.\n",
      "b. Make sure staff can get to epinephrine auto-injectors quickly and easily.\n",
      "Quick access to and immediate availability of epinephrine to respond to anaphylaxis emergencies is essential. 13 It is the parent's responsibility to provide at least one or two epinephrine auto-injectors for a child with food allergies if they are prescribed by a doctor. It is the school's or ECE program's responsibility to store epinephrine auto-injectors in a place that can be reached quickly and easily and to delegate and train staff to give epinephrine in response to allergic reactions.\n",
      "Studies have shown that quick access to epinephrine is critical to saving lives in episodes of anaphylaxis. 24,25,37 To ensure quick access to epinephrine, auto-injectors should be kept in a safe and secure place that trained staff members can get to quickly during school or ECE program hours. 63, At the same time, staff must also follow federal and state laws, including regulations, and local policies that may require medications to be locked in a secure place. For example, federal Head Start regulations require that all \"grantee and delegate agencies establish and maintain written procedures regarding the administration, handling, and storage of medication for every child,\" including \"labeling and storing, under lock and key, and refrigerating, if necessary, all medications, including those required for staff and volunteers. \" 51 State regulations and local policies may similarly require locking medications in a secure location. School and ECE program staff should seek guidance from federal and state regulatory agencies and local policy makers when deciding how to store epinephrine auto-injectors.\n",
      "These decisions also must take into account the needs of each student and the specific characteristics of the school district, the staff, and the school building. Decisions on where to store medication, such as in a central location (office or health room), in the classroom, or in several locations (on a large school campus) may vary among school districts and schools. These decisions should be based on state and local laws and regulations and school policies. They also must ensure the safety of children with food allergies. The Guidelines for Managing Life-threatening Food Allergies in Connecticut Schools list some issues to consider, including the general safety standards for handling and storage of medication, developmental stage and competence of the student, size of the building, availability of a full-time school nurse in the building, availability of communication devices between teachers and paraprofessionals who are inside the building or on the playground and the school nurse, school nurse response time from the health office to the classroom, preferences and other responsibilities of the teacher, preferences of the parent, preferences of the student (as applicable), and movement of the student within the building. 54 The location(s) of medications should be listed in the school's overall emergency plan and in each child's ECP (and IHP, Section 504 plan, or IEP, if appropriate). Schools and ECE programs should also identify which staff members will be responsible for reviewing expiration dates and replacing outdated epinephrine auto-injectors and for carrying medication during field trips and other school events. 70 c. Make sure that epinephrine is used when needed and someone immediately contacts emergency medical services.\n",
      "Delays in using epinephrine have resulted in near fatal and fatal food allergy reactions in schools and ECE programs. 25,36,37 In a food allergy emergency, trained staff should give epinephrine immediately.\n",
      "Early and appropriate administration of epinephrine can temporarily stop allergic reactions and provide the critical time needed to get medical help.\n",
      "State laws, state nursing regulations, and local school board policies direct the medication administration in school and ECE programs. They often define which medications nonhealth professionals are allowed to administer in schools, including who may administer epinephrine by auto-injector. If nonhealth staff members are permitted to administer epinephrine, training should be required. 39,71 When epinephrine is used, school or ECE program staff must call 911 or emergency medical services (EMS). EMS should be informed that the emergency is due to an allergic reaction, if epinephrine has been administered, when it was administered, and that an additional dose of epinephrine may be needed. The child should be transported quickly in an emergency vehicle to the nearest hospital emergency department for further medical treatment and observation. 13 Staff also should contact the child's parents to inform them of their child's food allergy emergency and tell them where the child is being transported. Because medical attention is needed urgently in this situation, staff must not wait for parents to come and pick up their children before calling EMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Justification for More Than One Dose of Epinephrine\n",
      "Schools and ECE programs should consider keeping multiple doses of epinephrine onsite so they can respond quickly to a food allergy emergency. Although some schools allow students to carry their own auto-injectors, a second auto-injector should be available at school in case a student does not have one at the time of the emergency. School and ECE program staff may also decide that having more than one auto-injector at different locations (especially for a large building or campus) will best meet a child's needs. In addition, some symptoms of anaphylaxis may continue after one dose of epinephrine, so a second dose may be needed at school if EMS does not arrive quickly. Some state laws allow for the prescribing of stock supply of non-patient specific epinephrine auto-injectors for use in schools, which may allow schools or ECE programs to acquire the needed additional doses of epinephrine. When allowed by state law and local policy, schools and ECE programs that have a doctor or nurse onsite can stock their emergency medical kits with epinephrine auto-injectors to be used for anaphylaxis emergencies. 63,65,66,72 In states where legislation does not exist or does not allow schools or ECE programs to stock epinephrine, staff will need to work with parents and their doctors to get additional epinephrine auto-injectors for students who need them.\n",
      "\n",
      "# d. Identify the role of each staff member in an emergency.\n",
      "Any plan for managing food allergies should state specifically what each staff member should do in an emergency. This information should be simple and easy to follow, particularly when a staff member who is not a licensed health professional is delegated to administer epinephrine. 24,68 Ideally, a registered nurse or doctor would be available to assess a food allergy emergency and decide if epinephrine is needed. When a nurse or doctor is not onsite, trained unlicensed assistive personnel or nonhealth professionals can recognize the signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction, have quick access to an epinephrine auto-injector, and administer epinephrine. 70,71 Examples of these staff members may include health aides and assistants, teachers, athletic coaches, food service staff, administrators, and parent or adult chaperones. A licensed health care professional such as a registered nurse, doctor, or allergist should train, evaluate, and supervise unlicensed assistive personnel or delegated nonhealth professionals. This training should teach staff how to recognize the signs and symptoms of a reaction, administer epinephrine, contact EMS, and understand state and local laws and regulations related to giving medication to students.\n",
      "ECE programs that care for children with chronic conditions such as food allergies should seek the services of a trained health advocate or consultant to help staff develop emergency plans, write policies, and train staff. ECE programs are required to have a certified first aider present at all times. 50 All ECE program staff should get annual first aid training that teaches them how to recognize and respond to pediatric emergencies. 49 This training should include how to recognize the signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction and how to give epinephrine through an auto-injector. 23 ECE programs should keep records of all staff training.\n",
      "\n",
      "# e. Prepare for food allergy reactions in children without a prior history of food allergies.\n",
      "Schools and ECE programs should be ready to respond to severe allergic reactions in children with no history of anaphylaxis or no previously diagnosed food allergies. At a minimum, schools and ECE programs should establish a protocol for contacting emergency services when an allergic reaction is suspected and follow this protocol immediately when a child exhibits signs of anaphylaxis.\n",
      "If allowed by state law, the school doctor or nurse may stock their emergency medical kits with epinephrine auto-injectors to be used for anaphylaxis emergencies. If the school or ECE program has a FAMPP, written protocol, and licensed or delegated trained staff, an epinephrine auto-injector may be used for anaphylaxis regardless of previous allergy history.\n",
      "f. Document the response to a food allergy emergency.\n",
      "Emergency response should include a protocol for documenting or recording each emergency incident and use of epinephrine. 12,65,68 Documentation should include the following:\n",
      "Â°Â°Time and location of the incident.\n",
      "Â°Â°Food allergen that triggered the reaction (if known).\n",
      "Â°Â°If epinephrine was used and the time it was used.\n",
      "Â°Â°Notification of parents and EMS.\n",
      "Â°Â°Staff members who responded to the emergency.\n",
      "Section 6 lists state and organizational resources that include examples of epinephrine administration reports.\n",
      "Corrective actions and lessons learned from an incident should be used to revise the child's individual plan and the school's or ECE program's FAMPP, if needed. School and ECE program administrators also should review the emergency response with the child's parents, the staff members involved in the response, local EMS responders, and the child. 63,70 See the Example Checklist for an example of steps to follow after a nonfatal food allergy emergency.\n",

      "# Provide professional development on food allergies for staff.\n",
      "Schools and ECE programs should provide training to all staff members to increase their knowledge about food allergies and how to respond to food allergy emergencies. This training should focus on how to reduce the risk of an allergic reaction, respond to allergic reactions, and support the social and academic development of children with food allergies. 25,38,73 Schools and ECE programs should coordinate training activities with a licensed health care professional, such as a school nurse, public health nurse, public health educator, or school or community doctor. Training can include use of existing materials that provide general information about food allergies, as well as information and resources to help staff meet the specific needs of individual children. 23,24,39,49,73,74 Administrators should allow enough time for proper training, and all training should be evaluated to make sure it is effective.\n",

      "a. Teach all children about food allergies.\n",
      "All children need to learn about food allergies, but teaching methods will differ on the basis of their age and the setting. For example, schools can provide food allergy education as part of the health education or other curriculum topic, such as family and consumer sciences, general science, physical education, and character education. 41,45,67,69,75,76 ECE programs can provide food allergy education with help from certified health education specialists.\n",
      "Food allergy education should be appropriate for the developmental level and culture of the children in a particular school or ECE program. It should focus on increasing awareness and understanding of food allergies and building support and acceptance of people with food allergies. 59,76 At a minimum, all children should be able to:\n",
      "Â°Â°Identify signs and symptoms of anaphylaxis.\n",
      "Â°Â°Know and understand why it is wrong to tease or bully others, including people with food allergies.\n",
      "Â°Â°Know and understand the importance of finding a staff member who can help respond to suspected food allergy emergencies.\n",
      "Â°Â°Understand rules on hand washing, food sharing, allergen-safe zones, and personal conduct.\n",
      "Food allergy awareness is reinforced when staff members model behaviors and attitudes that comply with rules that reduce exposure to food allergens. 48 b. Teach all parents and families about food allergies.\n",
      "A successful FAMPP needs support and participation from parents of children with food allergies and from parents of children without food allergies. All parents should get information to increase their awareness and understanding of food allergies, the policies and practices that protect children with food allergies, the roles of all staff members in protecting children with food allergies, and the measures parents of children with and without food allergies can take to help ensure this protection. 45,76 School and ECE program administrators, working with school or district nurses or health consultants or managers, should educate families on food allergy policies and practices. Classroom teachers should provide information to all parents about what is being done to prevent food allergy reactions in the classroom. Food service staff should provide information to families about federal regulations of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food and Nutrition Service and practices that protect children, and manage food allergies during meals served under USDA meal programs. District and school policies and protocols to prevent bullying, respond to food allergy emergencies, and create a safe environment for all children should be shared with all families.\n",
      "Schools and ECE programs can share information in many ways, including through letters or e-mails to parents; updates on school Web sites; and announcements at parent-teacher association meetings, school nights, health fairs, and community events.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Create and maintain a healthy and safe educational environment.\n",
      "Schools, ECE programs, and communities have a shared responsibility to promote a safe physical environment that protects children with food allergies and climate that supports their positive psychological and social development. 77,78 a. Create an environment that is as safe as possible from exposure to food allergens.\n",
      "Schools and ECE programs can create a safer learning environment by reducing children's exposure to potential allergens. 24,39,74 When a child has a documented food allergy, staff should take active steps to reduce the risk of exposure in all common areas, such as classrooms and cafeterias. 12 Some schools or ECE programs have considered banning or have banned specific food across the entire school or ECE program setting in an attempt to eliminate exposing a child with a food allergy to that food. But, such an option cannot guarantee a totally safe environment because there is no reasonable or fail-safe way to prevent an allergen from inadvertently entering into a building. Even with such a ban in place, a school or ECE program still has a responsibility to properly plan for children with any life-threatening food allergies, to educate all school personnel accordingly, and ensure that school staff are trained and prepared to prevent and respond to a food allergy emergency.\n",
      "Schools or ECE programs may choose other alternatives to banning allergens including the designation of allergen-safe zones, such as an individual classroom or eating area in the cafeteria, or designation of food-free zones, such as a library, classroom, or buses. 45 79 provide school districts, schools, and ECE programs with requirements governing the cleaning and sanitizing of surfaces and other practices that can protect against the unintentional transfer of residue or trace amount of an allergic food into another food. Some practices to reduce this cross-contact include the following:\n",
      "Â°Â°Clean and sanitize with soap and water or all-purpose cleaning agents and sanitizers that meet state and local food safety regulations, all surfaces that come into contact with food in kitchens, classrooms, and other locations where food is prepared or eaten. Cleaning with water alone will not remove food allergens.\n",
      "Â°Â°Clean and sanitize food preparation equipment, such as food slicers, and utensils before and after use to prevent cross-contact.\n",
      "Â°Â°Clean and sanitize trays and baking sheets after each use. Oils can seep through wax paper or other liners and cause cross-contact.\n",
      "Â°Â°Prepare food separately for children with food allergies. Strategies should include preparing items without allergens first, using a separate work space and equipment, and labeling and storing items before preparing other foods.\n",
      "Â°Â°Train all staff who prepare, handle, or serve food how to read labels to identify food allergens. Make sure that staff members are knowledgeable about current labeling laws. Because food labels often change, they should be read every time the food is purchased. Ingredient lists posted on Web sites are not reliable. The manufacturer of the food should be contacted if clarification is needed.\n",
      "Â°Â°Use appropriate hand-washing procedures that emphasize the use of soap and water. Hand sanitizers are not effective in removing food allergens.\n",
      "Nutrition and food service staff in schools and ECE programs are required to follow local food safety and sanitation laws and be trained in practices that prevent food, surface-to-food, and food-to-food contamination that also serve to help prevent cross-contact of food allergens. Meals and snacks may be served in locations other than cafeterias, handled by staff members other than the food service staff, or provided outside of a USDA Child Nutrition Program. When developing policies and procedures for food handling, consider all possible situations where food might be prepared or served, any staff members who might be involved, and the state and local food safety regulations that might be appropriate to help prevent the transfer of food allergens in these situations.\n",
      "In ECE programs, additional precautions are recommended to reduce the risk of food allergy reactions, especially among children with a history of anaphylaxis. Many of these recommendations are consistent with common practices for managing any child in an ECE program.\n",
      "Â°Â°Make sure that all staff members can read product labels and identify food allergens.\n",
      "Â°Â°Recommend, but do not require, that children with known food allergies wear a medical alert bracelet.\n",
      "Â°Â°Promote good hand-washing practices before and after eating.\n",
      "Â°Â°Supervise children closely during mealtimes. Consider assigned seating for meals, especially in situations with family-style dining. Emphasize that children not share food.\n",
      "Â°Â°Put children's names on cups, plates, and utensils to avoid confusion and cross-contact.\n",
      "Â°Â°Designate food storage areas for foods brought from home. 6,45,77 c. Make outside groups aware of food allergy policies and rules when they use school or ECE program facilities before or after hours.\n",
      "Local agencies, community groups, and community members who use school or ECE program facilities before or after operating hours should be aware of and comply with policies on food, cleaning, and sanitation procedures. If food is allowed in the building, consider banning food from specific classrooms or areas that children with food allergies use often. School and ECE program staff should be notified when outside groups are using their facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "# d. Create a positive psychosocial climate.\n",
      "Schools and ECE programs should foster a climate that promotes positive psychological and social development; that actively promotes safety, respect, and acceptance of differences; and fosters positive interpersonal relationships between staff members and children and between the children themselves. The psychosocial climate is influenced by clear and consistent disciplinary policies, meaningful opportunities for participation, and supportive behaviors by staff members and parents. 78 Children with food allergies need an environment where they feel secure and can interact with caring people they trust. Bullying, teasing, and harassment can lead to psychological distress for children with food allergies which could lead to a more severe reaction when the allergen is present. 22,43,44 A positive psychosocial climate-coupled with food allergy education and awareness for all children, families, and staff members-can help remove feelings of anxiety and alienation among children with food allergies. 43,44 To create a positive psychosocial climate, staff members, children, and parents must all work together. School nurses, school counselors, or mental health consultants can provide leadership and guidance to set best practices and strategies for a positive psychosocial climate. Staff members should promote and reinforce expectations for a positive and supportive climate by making sure the needs of children with food allergies are addressed. For example, they can avoid using language and activities that isolate children with food allergies and encourage everyone's help in keeping the classroom safe from food allergens. Children can help develop classroom rules, rewards, and activities.\n",
      "All children and staff members share responsibility for preventing bullying and social isolation of children with food allergies. School and ECE program staff should recognize that acceptance by peers is one of the most important influences on a child's emotional and social development. 78 Among adolescents, food allergy education and awareness can be an effective strategy to improve social interactions, reduce peer pressure, and decrease risk-taking behaviors that expose them to food allergens. 22 Children should be expected to treat others with respect and to be good citizens, not passive bystanders, when they are aware of bullying or peers who seem troubled. Children should understand the positive or negative consequences associated with their actions. Rules and policies against bullying behavior should be developed in partnership with staff members, families, and children. They should be posted in buildings; published in school handbooks; and discussed with staff members, children, and families. All children and staff members should be encouraged to report bullying and harassment of any child with food allergies. 80,81\n",

      "# Conclusion\n",
      "Schools and ECE programs are responsible for the health and safety of children with food allergies. The strategies presented in these guidelines can help schools and ECE programs take a comprehensive approach to managing food allergies. Through the collective efforts of school and ECE program staff members, parents, and health care providers, children with food allergies can be assured a safe place to thrive, learn, and succeed.\n",

      "# Section 3. Putting Guidelines into Practice: Actions for School Administrators and Staff\n",
      "Effective management of food allergies in schools requires the participation of many people. This section presents the actions that school building administrators and staff can take to implement the recommendations in Section 1. Some actions duplicate responsibilities required under applicable federal and state laws, including regulations, and policies. Although many of the actions presented here are not required by statute, they can contribute to better management of food allergies in schools.\n",
      "Some actions are intentionally repeated for different staff positions to ensure that critical actions are addressed even if a particular position does not exist in the district or school (e.g., school doctor). This duplication also reinforces the need for different staff members to work together to manage food allergies effectively. All actions are important, but some will have a greater effect than others. Some actions may be most appropriately carried out by district-level staff members whose roles are to support food allergy management plans and practices across schools or to provide specific services to schools that do not have an on-site staff person to provide these services. Ultimately, each school district or school must determine which actions are most practical and necessary to implement and who should be responsible for those actions.\n",

This section also addresses privacy and confidentiality requirements that apply to the education records of students with food allergies, regardless of whether they have been found to have a disability under federal law. Schools and ECE programs are encouraged to copy and distribute relevant laws to appropriate staff and to reinforce relevant laws and regulations in all training provided to staff. For information on how to get copies of relevant federal laws and regulations, see Section 6. g\n",

      "# Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (Section 504) and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) h\n",
      "Section 504 is a federal law that prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance. Recipients of federal financial assistance from ED include public school districts, other state and local educational agencies, and postsecondary educational institutions. The Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR) enforces Section 504 as it applies to these recipients. The USDA enforces Section 504 as it applies to recipients of federal financial assistance from USDA.\n",
      "Title II of the ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by public entities, including public elementary, secondary, and postsecondary educational institutions, whether or not they receive federal financial assistance. For public schools, OCR shares Title II enforcement responsibilities with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).\n",
      "Section 504 and Title II of the ADA require that qualified individuals with disabilities, including students, parents, and other program participants, not be excluded from or denied the benefits of services, programs, or activities or otherwise subjected to discrimination by reason of a disability. Public school districts that receive federal financial assistance are covered by both Section 504 and Title II. As a general rule, because Title II does not provide less protection than Section 504, violations of Section 504 also constitute violations of Title II. To the extent that Title II provides greater protections, schools must also comply with Title II and provide those additional protections.\n",
      "g. In addition to becoming familiar with these relevant federal laws, schools and ECE programs should determine which applicable state statutes, policies, and regulations and local statues and policies should be considered when developing management plans for children with food allergies. If a student's food allergy is a disability, that student is entitled to the protections of Section 504 and the ADA. Both laws define a disability as a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity. Children with food allergies may be substantially limited in major life activities such as eating, breathing, or the operation of major bodily functions such as the respiratory or gastrointestinal system. The U.S. Congress has made clear that the definition of disability under Section 504 and the ADA is to be construed broadly. i\n",
      "Under both Section 504 and Title II, students with disabilities in public schools must be given an equal opportunity to participate in academic, nonacademic, and extracurricular activities. ED's Section 504 regulation outlines a process for schools to use to determine whether a student has a disability and to determine what services a student with a disability needs. j This evaluation process must be tailored individually because each student is different, and his or her needs will vary. The Section 504 regulations specify that school districts must identify all students with disabilities and provide them with a free appropriate public education (FAPE).\n",
      "Under ED's Section 504 regulation, FAPE is the provision of regular or special education and related aids and services designed to meet the individual educational needs of students with disabilities as adequately as the needs of students who do not have disabilities are met. A student does not have to receive special education services, however, in order to receive related aids and services under Section 504. The most common practice is to include these related aids and services, as well as any needed special education services, in a written document, sometimes called a Section 504 plan. Even if a school district does not believe that a student needs special education or related aids and services, Section 504 and Title II require the district to consider whether it can reasonably modify policies, practices, or procedures to ensure that a student with a disability has an equal opportunity to participate in and benefit from the school's services and programs. ED's Section 504 regulation also states that public preschool and day care programs operated by recipients of federal funds may not, on the basis of disability, exclude students with disabilities and must take their needs into account when determining the aid, benefits, or services to be provided. k Under ED's Section 504 regulation, private schools that receive federal financial assistance may not exclude an individual student with a disability if the school can, with minor adjustments; provide an appropriate education to that student. Private, nonreligious schools and ECE programs are covered by Title III of the ADA. Title III prohibits public accommodations such as these from discriminating against individuals with disabilities in the full and equal enjoyment of the entity's services and activities. Under Title III, private schools and ECE programs must make reasonable modifications to policies, practices, and procedures when necessary to give children with disabilities, including those with food allergies, full and equal access to and participation in programs and services unless the entity can show that the modification would result in a fundamental alteration of those programs and services.\n",
      "Under Section 504 and the ADA, children with food allergy disabilities in schools and ECE programs must be provided with the services and modifications they need in order to attend. Examples of these services and modifications might include implementing allergen-safe food plans, administering epinephrine according to a doctor's orders (even if the school or ECE program has a no-medication policy), allowing students to carry their own medication, and providing an allergen-safe environment in which the student can eat meals. Disability harassment is a form of discrimination prohibited by Section 504 and Titles II and III of the ADA.\n",
      "Harassment creates a hostile environment when the conduct is sufficiently serious so as to interfere with or limit a student's ability to participate in or benefit from the services, activities, or opportunities offered by a school. When student-on-student disability harassment occurs and the school knows or reasonably should know about the harassment, a school must take prompt and effective steps reasonably calculated to end the harassment, prevent its recurrence, and eliminate any hostile environment created by the harassment. Section 504 and Title II require schools to take such steps and prohibit schools from encouraging, tolerating, or ignoring peer harassment based on disability that creates a hostile environment. Bullying, teasing, or harassment about an allergy can lead to psychological distress for children with food allergies which could lead to a more severe reaction when the allergen is present. And exposing an allergic child to the allergen (e.g., putting the allergen in the child's food or forcing the child to ingest the allergen) can have very serious-even fatal-consequences. School districts, in developing and implementing policies on bullying and harassment, should instruct staff and students as to how such policies apply to children with food allergies, including the possible disciplinary consequences for bullying and harassment that target or place food-allergic children at risk. Additional consequences could be to separate the harasser from the target and to provide counseling for the target or the harasser. Finally, a school should take steps to stop further harassment and prevent any retaliation against the person who made the complaint (or was the subject of the harassment) or against those who provided information as witnesses. The ADA, as amended, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, The Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act 42 USC 1758(a), the Child Nutrition Act, CNP regulations, and USDA's Non-discrimination regulations at 7 CFR 15b, govern meal accommodations for children with food related disabilities in schools and ECE programs that participate in the CNPs. USDA has oversight for providing meals in these programs. Program operators in the CNPs must make meal accommodations to regular program meals for children identified by a licensed doctor as having a food allergy disability that prevents them from consuming a meal as prepared. For purposes of discussion in these guidelines, if a child has a food allergy that is identified as a disability by a licensed doctor, meal accommodations must be provided.\n",
      "Additionally, a school, institution, and site participating in USDA's Child Nutrition Programs, is not required to establish a Section 504 plan, IEP, IHP, ICP (or any plan that may be used by a child with special dietary needs) to make an accommodation to a program meal for a child with a food related disability. Instead, the CNPs require a written statement from a licensed doctor which identifies the following requirements:\n",
      "- The child's disability (according to pertinent statutes).\n",
      "- An explanation of why the disability restricts the child's diet.\n",
      "- The major life activity affected by the disability.\n",
      "- The food or foods to be omitted from the child's diet.\n",
      "- The food or choice of foods that must be substituted. 62 A statement signed by a licensed doctor addressing the points above is sufficient. However, the written statement from a licensed doctor may be incorporated in any of the plans discussed above.\n",

      "# Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA)\n",
      "IDEA Part B l provides federal funds to help states make FAPE available to eligible children with disabilities in the least restrictive environment. The obligation to make FAPE available in the least restrictive environment begins at the child's third birthday and could last until the child's twenty-second birthday, depending on state law or practice. m FAPE under IDEA Part B refers to the provision of special education and related services at no cost to the parents that include an appropriate preschool, elementary school, or secondary school education at the state level. Eligibility determinations under IDEA Part B are made at the state and local school district level on an individual, case-by-case basis in light of applicable IDEA Part B requirements and state education standards. At the federal level, IDEA is administered by the Office of Special Education Programs in the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services in the ED.\n",
      "A child could be found eligible for services under IDEA Part B because of a food allergy only if it adversely affects the child's educational performance, and the child needs special education and related services because of the food allergy. If determined eligible, the school district must develop an Individualized Education Program (IEP) for the child, or if appropriate, an Individualized Family Service Plan (IFSP) for a child age three through five. n An IEP is a written document developed by a team that includes the child's parents and school officials. It sets out, among other elements, the special education and related services and supplementary aids and services to be provided to the child. If parents place their disabled child at a private school at their own expense, IDEA Part B generally would not require the school district to develop an IEP for the child at the private school. In general, if a child with a food allergy only needs a related service and does not need special education, that child would not be eligible for services under IDEA Part B. Such a child might still be eligible for services or modifications under Section 504 or Title II.\n",
      "In addition, IDEA Part C provides federal funds to assist states in identifying and providing early intervention services to children with disabilities from birth to age three and, at the state's discretion, through five or when the child enters kindergarten. Under IDEA Part C, a child is eligible based on a developmental delay, diagnosed condition, or, at the state's discretion, at-risk status. An IFSP is a document written by a team that includes the child's parents that identifies the specific early intervention services needed by the child. o\n",

      "# Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of 1974\n",
      "FERPA applies to educational agencies or institutions that receive federal funds under a program administered by ED. p FERPA generally prohibits schools and school districts from disclosing personally identifiable information from a student's education record unless the student's parent or the eligible student (a student who is aged 18 years or older or who attends an institution of postsecondary education) provides prior, written consent for the disclosure. This requirement has several exceptions. q One exception permits schools to disclose personally identifiable information from a student's education record without obtaining prior written consent to school officials, including teachers, who have legitimate educational interests in the information, including the educational interests of the child. Schools must use reasonable methods, such as physical, technological, or administrative access controls, to ensure that school officials obtain access only to those education records in which they have legitimate educational interests. To use this exception, schools must include in their annual notification of FERPA rights to parents and eligible students the criteria for determining who constitutes a school official and what constitutes a legitimate educational interest.\n",
      "This exception for school officials also applies to a contractor, consultant, volunteer, or other party to whom a school has outsourced institutional services or functions provided that the outside party:\n",
      "- Performs an institutional service or function for which the school would otherwise use employees.\n",
      "- Is under the direct control of the school with respect to the use and maintenance of education records.\n",
      "- Is subject to the requirements in FERPA that govern the use and redisclosure of personally identifiable information from education records.\n",
      "Another exception to the requirement of prior written consent permits schools to disclose personally identifiable information from an education record to appropriate parties, including the parent of an eligible student, in connection with an emergency if knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals. Under this exception, a school may take into account the totality of the circumstances pertaining to a threat to the health or safety of a student or other individuals. If a school determines that there is an articulable and significant threat to the health or safety of a student or other individuals, it may disclose information from education records to any person whose knowledge of the information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other individuals. If the information available at the time of the incident forms a rational basis for the decision to disclose information, ED will not substitute its judgment for that of the school in evaluating the circumstances and making its determination. When disclosures are made under this exception, a school must record the articulable and significant threat to the health or safety of a student or other individual that formed the basis for the disclosure and the parties to whom the information was disclosed.\n",
      "In addition, under FERPA, the parent or eligible student must be given the opportunity to inspect and review the student's education records. A school must comply with a request for access to the student's education records within a reasonable period of time, but not more than 45 days after it has received the request.\n",
      "Additional information and resources, including how to access copies of federal laws, are provided in Section 6.\n",
      "A food allergy is an adverse immune system reaction that occurs soon after exposure to a certain food. The immune response can be severe and life threatening. Although the immune system normally protects people from germs, in people with food allergies, the immune system mistakenly responds to food as if it were harmful. More information on food allergies is on pages 17-21 of the Voluntary Guidelines for Managing Food Allergies.Even a tiny amount of the allergy-causing food can trigger signs and symptoms such as digestive problems, hives or swollen airways. In some people, a food allergy can cause severe symptoms or even a life-threatening reaction known as anaphylaxis.# What is anaphylaxis?\n",
      "Anaphylaxis is a severe allergic reaction that is rapid in onset and may cause death. Not all allergic reactions will develop into anaphylaxis. In fact, most are mild and resolve without problems. However, early signs of anaphylaxis can resemble a mild allergic reaction. Unless obvious symptoms-such as throat hoarseness or swelling, persistent wheezing, or fainting or low blood pressure-are present, it is not easy to predict whether these initial, mild symptoms will progress to become an anaphylactic reaction that can result in death. Therefore, all children with known or suspected ingestion of a food allergen and the appearance of symptoms consistent with an allergic reaction must be closely monitored and possibly treated for early signs of anaphylaxis. More information on anaphylaxis is on page 19 of the Voluntary Guidelines for Managing Food Allergies.\n",
      "Why are the Voluntary Guidelines for Managing Food Allergies being disseminated now?\n",
      "Food allergies affect an estimated 4%-6% of U.S. children, most of whom attend federal-and state-supported schools or early care and education programs every weekday. Allergic reactions can be life threatening and have farreaching effects on children and their families, as well as on the schools or early care and education (ECE) programs they attend.\n",
      "In 2010 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) convened an expert panel to provide guidance for schools and early care and education programs. These guidelines are based on guidance from the panel and subsequent review and comment provided by the additional experts listed in the Acknowledgements on pages 5-6.\n",
      "In 2011, Congress passed the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act to improve food safety in the United States by shifting the focus from response to prevention.

      "Until now, no national guidelines had been developed to help schools and early care and education (ECE) programs address the needs of the growing numbers of children with food allergies. However, some states and many school districts have formal policies or guidelines to improve the management of food allergies in schools.

      "# INTRODUCTION\n",
      "Persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are at risk for having active tuberculosis (TB) disease (1-3 ) because of either reactivation of latent infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (4 ) or rapid progression of newly acquired infection (5 ). Active TB, in turn, may hasten the evolution of HIV-related disease, possibly through mechanisms involving increased cytokine production and accelerated HIV replication (6,7 ). Isoniazid preventive therapy administered to persons who have positive reactions to purified protein derivative (PPD) tuberculin is important in preventing active TB in the United States. However, HIV-infected persons may have compromised ability to react to PPD-tuberculin skin testing, because HIV infection is associated with an elevated risk for cutaneous anergy (8,9 ).\n",
      "In 1991, CDC published guidelines recommending that anergy skin testing be performed in conjunction with PPD-tuberculin skin testing for HIV-infected persons who are being evaluated for latent infection with M. tuberculosis (10 ). Demonstration of anergy in an HIV-infected, PPD-negative person at high risk for infection with M. tuberculosis was recommended as an indication for isoniazid preventive therapy. Since the publication of these guidelines, several studies have been conducted to examine the results of anergy and PPD skin testing in HIV-infected persons and the effect of isoniazid for the prevention of TB in anergic HIV-infected persons. In February 1997, CDC convened a meeting of consultants to discuss these recent publications and other available data. CDC has used both the results of discussions at this meeting and a review of published literature to prepare this updated report, which provides recommendations concerning the use of anergy testing for HIV-infected persons in the United States.\n",
      "\n",
      "# BACKGROUND Anergy in HIV Disease and Risk for Active TB in HIV-Infected Persons\n",
      "Anergy skin testing assesses the responses to skin-test antigens to which a cellmediated, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response is expected. Anergy or DTH tests placed by using the Mantoux method of intradermal injection have conventionally been classified as positive if an induration measuring â‰¥5 mm is observed at the injection site within 48-72 hours. Persons who have positive skin tests are considered to have relatively intact cell-mediated immunity. Persons who do not mount a DTH response are considered to be anergic and to be at elevated risk for complications of deficient cell-mediated immunity. PPD-tuberculin skin testing itself elicits a DTH reaction, so persons who have positive PPD responses are not anergic. Responsiveness to DTH antigens may be decreased in HIV-infected persons, and the 1991 guidelines (10 ) recommended the use of companion or \"control\" antigens in conjunction with PPD testing to provide additional information about a person's ability to mount a DTH response.\n",
      "Impaired DTH response, which is directly related to decreasing CD4+ T-lymphocyte count, is a predictive factor for progression of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and mortality in HIV-infected persons (11)(12)(13)(14). In some studies, after the data were stratified by CD4+ count, anergy skin-test results have provided additional prognostic information about HIV-related complications and death (11)(12)(13)(14). The results of several studies have suggested that HIV-infected persons diagnosed as anergic have a greater risk for active TB than do nonanergic, PPD-negative, HIV-infected persons from the same population (15)(16)(17)(18)(19). In addition, among HIV-infected persons who have positive PPD-tuberculin skin-test results, data from one study demonstrated that those who did not respond to testing with a control antigen had a higher risk for active TB than did PPD-positive persons who reacted to such testing (19 ). Although CD4+ counts in HIV-infected persons have been reported as inversely related to their risk for active TB, being anergic has in itself been associated with an elevated risk for TB, even after the data were stratified by CD4+ count (16,19 ). Two studies suggest that mortality may be increased in HIV-infected persons who have active TB and who do not respond to testing with PPD compared with patients who have TB and HIV infection from the same population who respond to PPD testing (20,21 ).\n",
      "\n",
      "# Anergy and Interpretation of PPD-Tuberculin Skin Tests\n",
      "The results from supplemental anergy testing, in conjunction with PPD-tuberculin skin testing, have been interpreted in two ways (10 ). A positive DTH response to anergy testing, in conjunction with a negative PPD skin-test result, has been interpreted as evidence that the negative PPD test result is a true negative and the person tested is not infected with M. tuberculosis. Lack of DTH response to anergy skin testing, in conjunction with a negative PPD skin-test result, has been interpreted as evidence that the person is unable to mount a positive response to PPD even if infected with M. tuberculosis.\n",
      "Certain issues, however, compromise the validity of both of these interpretations. Selective nonreactivity to PPD is a recognized phenomenon in some patients with active culture-positive TB (22,23 ). The observations that mumps reactivity may remain after loss of PPD reactivity (24 ) and that PPD boosting can occur in persons who have an initial positive reaction to control antigens (25)(26)(27) suggest the possibility that DTH response to other antigens may be preserved after loss of PPD reactivity. Therefore, a DTH response is not proof that a negative PPD applied at the same time indicates absence of infection with M. tuberculosis. Lack of response to one or more control antigens, however, does not always mean inability to respond to PPD. In populations in which the prevalence of tuberculin reactivity is high, the percentage of persons who react to PPD may be higher than the percentage reacting to several other antigens (28,29 ). Even in populations in which the prevalence of PPD positivity is low, some persons respond to PPD testing despite lack of response to a companion antigen (19 ). Furthermore, a valid demonstration of anergy does not predict infection with M. tuberculosis; instead, it indicates that, for the anergic person, the PPD test results may not be useful in judging the likelihood of infection with M. tuberculosis and the need for TB preventive therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "# ANERGY SKIN TESTING AND DECISIONS REGARDING TB PREVENTIVE THERAPY\n",
      "Because of the complications associated with active TB in HIV-infected persons, these persons must be screened for latent TB infection and receive complete preventive treatment with isoniazid if indicated. Several factors limit the usefulness of anergy skin testing for making decisions regarding TB preventive therapy for HIV-infected persons in the United States. These factors include problems with the standardization and reproducibility of anergy skin-testing methods, the variable risk for TB associated with a diagnosis of anergy, and the lack of documented benefit of anergy skin testing as part of screening programs for M. tuberculosis infection among HIV-infected persons.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Difficulties in Interpreting Anergy Skin-Testing Results\n",
      "The decision of whether to perform anergy testing cannot be separated from determining how to perform it. Lack of standardization and lack of outcome data based on uniform antigens and tests are among the greatest obstacles to evaluating the effectiveness of anergy testing and making decisions concerning TB preventive therapy. Studies have been based on a variety of control antigen preparations and skin-test administration and methods for reading test results. Studies involving multiple-DTH antigen panels have demonstrated that several antigens may be necessary to maximize the likelihood that all persons able to respond are identified (29,30 ). DTH responses may vary in different populations of immunocompetent groups (31 ). DTH reactions of <5 mm of induration have been reported in young children (32 ), who might not be expected to have fully developed cellular immunity, and reactions of <5 mm of induration also have been noted in response to diluent without antigen (33)(34)(35).\n",
      "The variability in test readings noted for the PPD-tuberculin skin test (36,37 ) is likely to be associated with other DTH tests. Data from one study of variation between duplicate PPD tests (37 ), indicated that more than half of the discordant readings occurred in persons with one test measured as zero and the other as 1-4 mm of induration. Serial anergy testing among HIV-infected persons has shown unpredictable differences over time (24,38 ). This variation may result from changes in host immune competence or from characteristics of the tests themselves. Furthermore, the choice and number of companion antigens and the criteria used for the interpretation of results of anergy testing may lead to false classification of a) persons with intact cell-mediated immunity as anergic or b) anergic persons as nonanergic.\n",
      "The applicability of skin-testing methods to pediatric populations is uncertain. Children who have HIV infection have had DTH responses, and lack of response has been associated with the stage of HIV-related disease (39,40). However, no clear utility of anergy testing for the evaluation for TB among children has been established (41 ). Skin testing for DTH reactions is an important tool in diagnosing a variety of primary immunodeficiency diseases (i.e., non-HIV-related immunodeficiency diseases). Therefore, any recommendations regarding anergy testing should take into account its value in patients who have primary immunodeficiency diseases.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Anergy and Risk for Active TB\n",
      "In studies conducted both in the United States and elsewhere, no definite association has been determined between anergy and the risk for active TB in HIV-infected persons; the results of these studies indicated that the magnitude of the risk is variable and the reason for the variation uncertain. Rates of TB in groups defined as anergic have ranged from zero to >12 per 100 person-years. The risk for active TB in anergic HIV-infected persons may be associated with ongoing risk for M. tuberculosis transmission (i.e., residence in areas of high TB case rates), rather than with a high probability of latent M. tuberculosis infection alone (15)(16)(17)(18)(19)(42)(43)(44)(45). This finding implies that any effect of isoniazid preventive therapy might be attributable not only to prevention of reactivation of latent infection, but also (or instead) to primary prophylaxis against new acquisition of infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Effect of TB Preventive Therapy in Anergic Persons\n",
      "Two recent studies of 6 months of isoniazid preventive therapy among anergic persons at risk for infection with M. tuberculosis have been conducted. One study involving HIV-positive anergic patients in the United States demonstrated no statistically significant effect of therapy, despite a 56% reduction in rates of TB from 0.9 per 100 person-years in placebo recipients to 0.4 per 100 person-years in isoniazid recipients (42 ). The failure to find statistical significance with a 56% point estimate for protection may result from a lower-than-expected TB case rate in placebo recipients. Researchers concluded that, because the TB rate in the untreated group was low (0.9%), preventive therapy would have minimal impact in reducing the number of incident TB cases among HIV-positive anergic persons but would result in a substantial number of uninfected persons being treated with isoniazid. The other study, involving HIV-positive anergic patients in Kampala, Uganda, demonstrated a high TB case rate (three per 100 person-years) in placebo recipients, but only a statistically insignificant (17%) reduction in isoniazid recipients (43 ). In summary, even if anergic HIV-infected persons are assumed to be at high risk for active TB and are administered isoniazid preventive therapy, the effectiveness of this intervention has not been established for this population.\n",
      "\n",
      "# METHODS AND USES FOR ANERGY SKIN TESTING\n",
      "Mumps and Candida antigens have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for intradermal DTH testing to assess cell-mediated immunity. Mumps skin-test antigen has been available for a longer time; lack of response to mumps antigen in HIV-infected persons has been associated with risk for TB (19 ), but some patients who have lost PPD reactivity with progression of HIV disease may still react to mumps (24 ). Candida DTH skin-test antigen was approved more recently. Data linking DTH response to this Candida antigen and risk for TB are limited, and published studies describing Candida skin-test responses have used different products marketed as allergenic extracts.\n",
      "Both mumps and Candida antigens are applied by using the Mantoux method. The number of control antigens and the method of reading may affect the usefulness of Mantoux-method skin tests. More than two control antigens may be needed to avoid misclassifying immunocompetent persons as anergic (29,30 ). Limited information is available regarding the sensitivity and specificity of the two FDA-approved DTH tests used together. Other antigens (e.g., fluid tetanus toxoid and Candida extracts marketed for allergy testing) frequently are used for anergy testing, but with differing preparations, dosages, and dilutions.\n",
      "The conventional cut-off measurement of induration diameter for interpreting a Mantoux-method skin-test result as positive is 5 mm of induration. In recent years, attempts have been made to detect DTH in HIV-infected patients by using smaller cut-off diameters (3 mm, 2 mm, 1 mm, or \"any induration\"). In addition to the validity concerns already noted, the use of smaller cut-offs is subject to technical difficulties (46 ) and has not improved predictive value. A multiple-puncture test battery (MULTITEST CMI Â® ), which includes seven antigens and a diluent control, has been approved by the FDA for DTH testing. Results have been associated with clinical outcomes in several studies of HIV-infected persons (12,(15)(16)(17). The use of this product, however, is likely to be limited by cost and availability.\n",
      "Because several studies suggest a relationship between anergy and risk for TB, health-care providers may find the results of anergy testing useful in individual situations, despite the lack of consensus on how to perform anergy skin testing. Efforts to apply the results of anergy testing to evaluation of latent TB infection and preventive therapy decisions should be supplemented by information concerning the person's risk for exposure to and infection with M. tuberculosis. Used in this way, anergy tests, in conjunction with PPD testing, may assist in estimating TB risk for selected HIVinfected patients in specific situations. If a decision is made to perform anergy testing, technical expertise, feasibility, and cost may be important factors in choosing which test(s) to employ. The purpose of anergy testing also may be a factor: if the primary concern is to avoid misclassifying anergic persons as nonanergic, the use of two Mantoux-method tests with a 5-mm of induration cut-off may be appropriate. Use of more antigens may be indicated, however, if the primary concern is to avoid misclassifying immunocompetent persons as anergic. The expertise of the health-care provider and a clear understanding of the limitations of anergy testing are critical to appropriate use.\n",
      "\n",
      "# ROLE OF ANERGY SKIN TESTING IN TB PREVENTION AND CONTROL PROGRAMS\n",
      "Isoniazid preventive therapy administered to HIV-positive persons who have positive reactions to PPD tuberculin is important both as a personal health intervention and as part of efforts to prevent active TB disease in the United States. The prevalence of M. tuberculosis infection and active TB disease differs among different groups of the U.S. population infected with HIV. To reach a community's groups at high risk for TB, CDC has recommended that the design of tuberculin screening programs be based on local data regarding the prevalence and incidence of M. tuberculosis infection and the sociodemographic characteristics of patients with TB and M. tuberculosis infection (47 ).\n",
      "In studies conducted in the United States in which preventive therapy was administered principally to PPD-positive persons (44,45 ), no cases of TB were observed in anergic persons. (In one of these reports, selected anergic persons also received isoniazid .) In a multicenter study (19 ), the effect of area of residence on risk for TB was much greater than that of anergy. The precise risk for TB in HIV-positive anergic persons in the United States cannot be determined; however, the overall risk seems to be low. In addition, there are no simple skin-testing protocols that can reliably identify persons as either anergic or nonanergic and that have been proven to be feasible for application in public health tuberculosis screening programs. In the United States, the public health impact of finding and treating patients who have infectious TB to prevent further transmission and of providing preventive therapy to PPDpositive, HIV-infected persons to prevent additional infectious TB cases should be greater than the effect of preventive therapy for HIV-positive anergic persons.\n",
      "\n",
      "# RECOMMENDATIONS Programmatic Use of Anergy Testing\n",
      "Since the publication of guidelines in 1991, additional information has documented limitations in the usefulness of anergy testing in public health tuberculosis screening programs. These limiting factors include the variability in the available anergy testing methods, their lack of reproducibility, the variation in absolute risk for TB among different anergic groups, and the lack of demonstrated efficacy of a preventive therapy program in anergic HIV-infected groups. Therefore, anergy testing in conjunction with PPD-tuberculin testing is no longer routinely recommended for inclusion in screening programs for M. tuberculosis infection among HIV-infected persons. However, DTH evaluation may assist in guiding individual decisions regarding preventive therapy in selected situations.\n",
      "\n",
      "# TB Preventive Therapy Among HIV-Positive, PPD-Positive Persons\n",
      "Unless specifically contraindicated, HIV-positive persons a) who have positive reactions to PPD tuberculin (â‰¥5 mm of induration), b) who have not already been treated for TB infection, and c) whose test results exclude active TB should be considered for 12 months of preventive therapy with isoniazid (48 ). This preventive therapy is indicated even if the date of PPD skin-test conversion cannot be determined.\n",
      "\n",
      "# TB Preventive Therapy Among HIV-Positive, PPD-Negative Persons\n",
      "When assessing HIV-infected persons who have negative PPD-tuberculin skin-test results or who are known to be anergic, the most important factors in considering TB preventive therapy are the likelihood of exposure to transmissible active TB and the likelihood of latent M. tuberculosis infection. Preventive therapy should be considered for HIV-infected persons who do not have a documented positive PPD-tuberculin response but who have had recent contact with patients who have infectious pulmonary TB. Repeat PPD testing of initially PPD-negative contacts 3 months after cessation of contact with infectious TB is sometimes used to assist in decisions about duration of preventive therapy (49 ). However, most of these patients should complete a full 12-month course of isoniazid preventive therapy.\n",
      "In certain cases, preventive therapy with isoniazid for persons who are not PPD positive also may be considered. Such therapy may be beneficial for a) children who are born to HIV-infected women and are close contacts of a person who has infectious TB and b) HIV-infected adults who reside or work in institutions and are continually and unavoidably exposed to patients who have infectious TB. Some experts recommend continuing isoniazid preventive therapy indefinitely for HIV-infected persons who have an ongoing high risk for exposure to M. tuberculosis (e.g., inmates of prisons in which the prevalence of TB is high). In these situations, the results of anergy testing may be useful for deciding which persons should be offered prolonged preventive therapy in settings in which a) exposure is likely but PPD conversion has not occurred, b) the consideration of primary prophylaxis may arise, and c) the most vulnerable persons in immunologic terms may have high priority for preventive therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Future Programmatic Directions\n",
      "For formulating future recommendations regarding programmatic uses of anergy testing, results from systematic studies of the two FDA-approved Mantoux-method tests used together with a cut-off diameter of 5-mm of induration would be useful, as would comparisons between results with this combination and with the sevenantigen multipuncture battery. Ultimately, development of a simpler standard skin test or of another method for measuring the same components of immune responses more reliably is desirable.\n",
      "\n",
      "# CONCLUSIONS\n",
      "Recent studies suggest that impaired DTH is related to risk for active TB in some HIV-infected populations, despite variability in anergy skin-testing procedures. When a clinician elects to use anergy testing as part of a multifactorial assessment of a person's risk for TB, the two FDA-approved Mantoux-method tests (mumps and Candida ), used together and with cut-off diameters of 5 mm of induration, are recommended. Studies based on these approaches may result in data useful for formulating guidelines regarding future programmatic uses of anergy testing. Improvements in TB screening and preventive therapy practices in HIV-infected persons require better standardization of anergy testing methods and validation of their predictive value or development of an adequate alternative measure of cellular immunity or of an alternative test for the detection of latent TB infection.\n",
      "In selected situations, anergy testing may assist in guiding individual decisions regarding individual therapy. However, results of currently available anergy-testing methods in U.S. populations have not been demonstrated to make a useful contribution to most decisions about isoniazid preventive therapy. Therefore, anergy testing is no longer recommended as a routine component of TB screening among HIV-infected persons in the United States.\n",

      "Interviewing case-patients about where and what they ate in the days or weeks before they got sick is a critical component to hypothesis generation during an outbreak investigation. Interviews can also identify high-risk casepatients who could spread their infections to others (e.g., food handlers, day care workers or attendees, healthcare workers). During interviews, casepatients can also receive information about risky exposures and how to protect themselves and others. The FoodCORE Model Practice: Initial Case-patient Interviewing is intended to describe the basic practices and characteristics of conducting comprehensive interviews for all enteric disease case-patients upon initial identification or first contact, not just those identified as part of a local cluster or multistate cluster. The activities described would be applicable for various pathogens but are focused on those that are likely transmitted via food. Depending on jurisdictional resources, attempts should be made to interview all identified case -patients with enteric disease to ascertain an exposure history. This model practice describes successful triage and routing of case reporting and the process of attempting interviews with case-patients, recommends categories and elements identified as essential to ascertain during an initial enteric disease interview, and provides a checklist to determine alignment of initial interview practices with the FoodCORE model practice.# Timeliness, timing, and description of interview attempts:\n",
      "Interviews should be attempted as soon as public health officials are notified of a case-patient. This may be before all subtyping is completed. Prompt interviewing is critical to improve exposure recall and increase the likelihood of identifying leftover products to collect for testing. Additionally, early interviewing provides an opportunity for prompt prevention education to limit additional transmission, especially if a case-patient is identified in a high-risk setting (i.e., foodhandlers, childcare, or health care setting).\n",
      "At least three attempts should be made to contact a case-patient. Attempts should be made at different times of day, with at least one attempt during evening or weekend hours, if possible. During initial contact, interviewers can determine if the interview would be better conducted at a different time, confirm case-patient contact information, and (resource dependent) arrange for the interview to be conducted with an interpreter or other means of translation service, if necessary.\n",
      "If a case-patient cannot be reached for interview via telephone, FoodCORE centers have used the following approaches to attempt to ascertain exposure history and/or conduct prevention education:\n",
      "- Provide Case-patients with call back information, either a toll-free or direct line for reaching an interviewer.\n",
      "- Provide a letter from the relevant public health agency with the reason for attempted contact and providing both contact information and educational materials about the enteric pathogen and prevention. See Appendix C for sample letters.\n",
      "- Some centers are working on a novel approach to provide online questionnaires for exposure ascertainment. This method of exposure ascertainment is used as an alternative method for case-patients who cannot be reached or are unwilling to complete an interview over the phone but would like to provide their exposure history online. Online systems for self-reported data must be secure and allow for confidential data submission.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Interview content:\n",
      "FoodCORE initial case-patient interviews include elements from the following major categories: For all case-patients of enteric disease, data collected in categories 1-5 are needed to identify case-patients where public health officials can provide educational information to prevent additional illnesses and to identify any events or local trends that could indicate ongoing risk. FoodCORE center initial interviews include elements in categories 6 and 7 as part of a full exposure history. Depending on jurisdictional resources, interviews should collect sufficient detail to enable public health investigation in these categories. As resources allow, jurisdictions can evaluate including a detailed food exposure history as part of an initial interview. Other initiatives, including the Listeria Initiative, the STEC Standard Form, and the SNHGQ, have suggested food categories and elements to ascertain in a food history (e.g., Meat and Poultry; Fish and Seafood; Eggs, Dairy, and Cheese; Fruits and Vegetables; Frozen and Convenience Foods).\n",
      "For successful interviews, interviewers should be familiar with the questionnaire and jurisdictional policies for education and intervention so the case-patient interaction is efficient and comfortable. The content and structure of the initial interview should be understandable, and sensitive to the personal nature of the questions. FoodCORE centers have implemented the following practices and considerations:\n",
      "- The order in which elements are asked can influence how responsive a case-patient may be Â» More sensitive information should be collected after the case-patient is comfortable with the interviewer and the reason for being contacted\n",

      "Surveillance guidelines that include standardized case definitions for reporting of notifiable infectious diseases are important public health tools that contribute to the assessment of disease trends, measurement of intervention effectiveness, and detection of disease outbreaks (1). Comparable surveillance guidelines for the classification and reporting of adverse reactions after vaccination are nominal and have not com-monly include standardized case definitions (2,3). The term vaccine-related \"complication\" is often used interchangeably with the terms \"side effects\" or \"adverse reaction\" and should be distinguished from the term \"adverse event.\" An adverse reaction is an untoward effect that occurs after a vaccination and is extraneous to the vaccine's primary purpose of producing immunity (e.g., eczema vaccinatum). Adverse reactions have been demonstrated to be caused by the vaccination. In contrast, adverse events are untoward effects observed or reported after vaccinations, but a causal relation between the two have yet to be established. This report focuses on adverse reactions known to be caused by smallpox vaccine (with the exception of dilated cardiomyopathy that has not been shown to have a causal relation) on the basis of scientific evidence. Uniform criteria for classification of adverse reaction reports after smallpox (vaccinia) vaccination have been established. Criteria for dilated cardiomyopathy, an adverse event (not shown to have a causal relation with smallpox vaccination), also have been established. These case definitions and reporting guidelines were used by CDC and the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs during the mandatory Department of Defense (DoD) and voluntary U.S. DHHS smallpox vaccination programs that were designed to increase national preparedness in the event of a biologic terrorism attack (4)(5)(6).\n",
      "Adverse reactions caused by smallpox vaccination range from mild and self-limited to severe and life-threatening. During the recent smallpox vaccination programs, CDC, DoD, and the joint Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP)-Armed Forces Epidemiological Board (AFEB) Smallpox Vaccine Safety Working Group (SVS WG) relied on surveillance data from the smallpox pre-eradication era to estimate frequencies of adverse reactions expected during these vaccination programs. These estimates might be limited because the targeted population during the 1960s was mostly children who had never been previously vaccinated; the recent program targeted healthy adults, some of whom had received smallpox vaccines (6). Furthermore, adverse reactions during the 1960s were classified and reported by providers on the basis of subjective clinical diagnosis, and standard collection or analytical tools were not applied to the clinical data (7)(8)(9)(10)(11). Without explicit criteria for identifying cases for public health surveillance, state health departments and individual practitioners often apply different criteria for reporting similar cases (1). Surveillance data for adverse reactions after smallpox vaccination must be aggressively pursued and standardized to assess accurately the frequency of adverse events after smallpox vaccination.\n",
      "This report describes the case definitions used to classify reported adverse events during the DHHS smallpox vaccination program. The overall safety surveillance system and related findings are reported elsewhere (12).\n",
      "\n",
      "# Reporting Guidelines\n",
      "These surveillance case definitions establish reporting criteria for prospective or retrospective classification of cases. Clinical, laboratory, and epidemiologic information are necessary for accurate case classification, which could not be obtained without cooperation and information exchange between treating health-care providers, state health officials, laboratorians, and CDC. Any adverse event after smallpox vaccination should be reported to state health departments and the Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS), particularly those events known to be adverse reactions (Table 1). Any adverse reaction that requires treatment with vaccine immune globulin (VIG) or cidofovir should be reported immediately, and adverse events that meet the regulatory criteria for \"serious\" (i.e., those resulting in hospitalization, permanent disability, life-threatening illness, or death) (13) should be reported within 48 hours; all other events should be reported within 1 week (14). Reports can be submitted to VAERS at http:// www.vaers.hhs.gov, 877-721-0366, or P.O. Box 1100, Rockville, MD 20849-1100. Report forms and assistance with reporting are available from VAERS (800-822-7967).\n",
      "\n",
      "# Case Definition and Classification\n",
      "ACIP-AFEB SVS WG was responsible for safety oversight of the DHHS and DoD smallpox preparedness programs. The majority of the case definitions for vaccinia adverse reactions were drafted by the Vaccinia Case Definition Development working group in collaboration with ACIP-AFEB SVS WG. The Vaccinia Case Definition Development working group membership included CDC and DoD medical epidemiologists, smallpox eradication experts, ophthalmologists, dermatologists, cardiologists, and infectious-disease specialists. These work groups contributed to the development of case definitions by completing literature searches, translating publications, coordinating or participating in meetings, collecting or analyzing data, investigating cases, providing subject-matter expertise, and drafting and revising case definitions. The case definition for fetal vaccinia was developed by CDC and DoD for use in the development of the National Smallpox Vaccine in Pregnancy Registry (15).\n",
      "For all cases, exposure to vaccinia is required; vaccination, close contact with a recent vaccinee, or intrauterine exposure can fulfill this criterion. Vaccinia virus can be transmitted from the vaccination site to close contacts of persons who received smallpox vaccine, and these contacts can experience the same adverse reactions as vaccinees.\n",
      "Smallpox vaccine adverse events can be divided into several categories. Localized reactions include a superinfection of the vaccination site or regional lymph nodes and robust take (RT). Unintentional transfer of vaccinia virus includes transfer from the vaccination site to elsewhere on the vaccinee's body and is called inadvertent autoinoculation. When the virus is transferred from the vaccinee to a close contact, it is called contact transmission. In either case, if the virus is transferred to the eye and surrounding orbit, it is referred to as ocular vaccinia. Diffuse dermatologic complications include two groups. The first group (hypersensitivity rashes) includes nonspecific, postvaccination rash, erythema multiforme minor, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. These lesions are not thought to contain vaccinia virus, and because these terms are defined elsewhere in the dermatologic literature, they not included in this report. The second group of diffuse dermatologic complications is thought to be caused by replicating vaccinia virus that can be recovered from the rash of generalized vaccinia (GV) (usually a benign, self-limiting condition), eczema vaccinatum (EV) (often associated with substantial morbidity), and progressive vaccinia (PV) (which is generally fatal). Rare adverse reactions include fetal vaccinia and postvaccinial central nervous system diseases such as post-vaccinial encephalitis or encephalomyelitis. Other reactions previously reported but not well described include the newly characterized cardiac adverse reaction, myo/pericarditis (M/P) or the newly described cardiac adverse event dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), which has not been yet been demonstrated to be etiologically linked.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Localized Reactions\n",
      "\n",
      "# Superinfection of the Vaccination Site or Regional Lymph Nodes\n",
      "Vaccination progression and normal local reactions are difficult to distinguish from a superinfection of the vaccination site or regional lymph nodes. Secondary infections (i.e., superinfections) of the vaccination site are uncommon (rate: 0.55 per 10,000 vacinees) (16) and are typically mild to moderate in clinical severity (Box 1). Persons at greatest risk are children and those who frequently manipulate and contaminate the vaccination site. Occlusive dressings might lead to maceration and increased risk for infection. Secondary streptococcal bacterial infection has been reported ( 9), but anaerobic organisms and mixed infections also might be expected.\n",
      "Distinguishing superinfection of the vaccination site or regional lymph nodes can be particularly challenging because both a bacterial cellulitis and a variant of the normal major reaction or RT have similar signs and symptoms.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Robust Take\n",
      "An RT is a vaccinial cellulitis and is defined as >3 inches (7.5 cm) of redness with swelling, pain, and warmth at the vaccination site. These symptoms peak on days 6-12 postvaccination and regress within the following 24-72 hours. RTs can occur in up to 16% of smallpox vaccinees (16,17). Suspected bacterial cellulitis after smallpox vaccination is often treated empirically with antibiotics without a period of observation, and bacterial or other cultures are rarely obtained. As clinicians have gained experience with smallpox vaccination, some have ceased treating empirically with antibiotics in favor of close observation. Clinical observations suggest that the majority of vaccinees' local symptoms resolved without intervention, leading providers to conclude that these cases were RTs (CDC, unpublished data, 2002). In contrast to an RT, superinfections refer to cellulitis caused by agents other than vaccinia.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Unintentional Transfer of Vaccinia Virus Inadvertent Autoinoculation\n",
      "Unintentional transfer of vaccinia virus includes transfer from the vaccination site (or probable site of inoculation in a person infected with vaccinia through contract transmission) to elsewhere on the vaccinee's (or contact's) body, which is called inadvertent autoinoculation (Box 2). Smallpox vaccinees or contacts can transfer vaccinia virus to their hands or fomites, which becomes a source for infection elsewhere on the body. The most common nonocular sites are the face, nose, mouth, lips, genitalia, and anus. Lesions at autoinoculation sites progress through the same stages (e.g., papular, vesicular, pustular, crusting, and scab) as the vaccination site. When autoinoculation occurs >5 days postvaccination, the developing immune response might attenuate the lesions and their progression. Persons at highest risk for inadvertent autoinoculation are children aged 1-4 years and those with disruption of the epidermis, including but not limited to abrasions and burns (17).\n",
      "\n",
      "# Contact Transmission\n",
      "When the virus is transferred from the vaccinee to a close contact, this transmission is termed contact transmission. Persons in close contact with a recent vaccinee or associated vectors (e.g., distant lesions on a vaccinee resulting from inadvertent autoinoculation, clothing, bedding, or bandages contaminated by vaccinia) might acquire vaccinia infection. Vaccinia virus is shed from the vaccination site or from dis-tant lesions caused by autoinoculation, GV, EV, or PV (Box 3). Viral shedding might occur until the scab detaches from the vaccination site or distant lesions; virus can survive for several days on clothing, bedding, or other fomites (18). Although virus exists in the scab, it is bound in the fibrinous matrix, and the scab is not thought to be highly infectious (17). Infection acquired through contact transmission can result in the same adverse events observed after smallpox vaccination.\n",
      "\n",
      "# Ocular Vaccinia\n",
      "In the case of either contact transmission or inadvertent autoinoculation, if the virus is transferred to the eye and surrounding orbit, this transmission is referred to as ocular vac-cinia. Ocular vaccinial infections result from the transfer of vaccinia from the vaccine site or other lesion containing vaccinia to or near the eye. These infections account for the majority of inadvertent inoculations (11) (Box 4). Infections can be clinically mild to severe and can lead to vision loss. When suspected, ocular vaccinia infections should be evaluated with a thorough eye examination, including use of a slit lamp. These cases should be managed in consultation with an ophthalmologist.\n",

      "\n",
      "# Generalized Vaccinia\n",
      "GV is a disseminated vesicular or pustular rash and is usually benign and self-limited among immunocompetent hosts (Box 5). GV might be accompanied by fever and can produce skin lesions anywhere on the body. GV also can appear as a regional form that is characterized by extensive vesiculation around the vaccination site or as an eruption localized to a single body region (e.g., arm or leg). The skin lesions of GV are thought to contain virus spread by the hematogenous route. First-time vaccinees are at higher risk for GV than revaccinees (22). GV is often more severe among persons with underly-ing immunodeficiency who might have been inadvertently vaccinated; these patients might benefit from early intervention with VIG. GV should not be confused with multiple inadvertent inoculations that might occur in the presence of acute or chronic exfoliative, erosive, or blistering skin disease, including Darier's disease.- GV also should be differentiated from EV, which typically occurs in persons with a history of atopic dermatitis and is often associated with systemic illness.\n",

      "Persons with a history of atopic dermatitis (i.e., eczema) are at highest risk for EV (Box 6). Onset of the characteristic lesions can occur concurrently or shortly after the occurrence of the reaction at the vaccination site. EV cases resulting from Inadvertent autoinoculation occurs when a person who has received smallpox vaccine or experienced inoculation from contact might physically transfer vaccinia virus from vaccination or contact site to another part of the body through scratching or through inanimate objects such as clothing, dressings, or bedding. The most common sites of inadvertent autoinoculation, nonocular are the face, nose, mouth, lips, genitalia, and anus. Lesions at autoinoculation sites progress through the same papular, vesicular, and pustular stages as the vaccination site. When autoinoculation occurs more than 5 days postvaccination, the developing immune response might attenuate the lesions and their progression.

Two thirds of potential smallpox vaccinees failed to recall an exclusionary dermatologic condition such as atopic dermatitis (eczema) in themselves or their close contacts (23). Poor recall and inconsistent diagnosis of atopic dermatitis contributes to a challenging screening program to exclude persons at risk for EV (24). Therefore, when evaluating vaccinees or close contacts of recent vaccinees with a clinical presentation consistent with EV, despite a negative self-reported history of atopic dermatitis or Darier's disease, clinicians should consider EV and assess for treatment with VIG.\n",

      "# Progressive Vaccinia\n",
      "PV is rare, severe, and often fatal and results when a vaccination site fails to heal and vaccinia virus replication persists. The skin surrounding the vaccination site becomes vaccinia infected, and secondary metastatic vaccinia lesions can occur (Box 7). Lesions can appear necrotic, fungated, piled-up, or well demarcated. Concomitant bacterial superinfection also can occur. PV typically occurs in persons with an underlying humoral or cellular immune deficit. Management of PV should include aggressive therapy with VIG or second line agent cidofovir, intensive monitoring, and tertiary-level supportive care (17).\n",

      "Rarely, smallpox vaccination of a pregnant woman can result in fetal vaccinia (Box 8). Transmission to the fetus can occur any time during pregnancy. The route of transmission is unknown but is presumed to be through viremia. Abortion, stillbirth, or live birth (usually premature followed by death) or birth of a surviving but pox-scarred infant can occur after the mother's exposure to vaccinia. Fetal or newborn skin lesions have been described as macular, papular, vesicular, pustular, or as scars or areas of epidermolysis (15). Contact transmission of vaccinia virus occurs when virus shed from smallpox vaccination sites or from distant lesions in persons with inadvertent autoinoculation, generalized vaccinia (GV), eczema vaccinatum (EV), or progressive vaccinia (PV) is transferred to another person. Virus might be shed until the scab heals. The virus can survive for several days on clothing, bedding, or other inanimate surfaces. An unvaccinated or nonrecently vaccinated person in close contact (i.e., touching a person's lesions or vaccination site, clothing, bedding, or bandages) with a vaccinee or their inanimate objects might acquire vaccinia infection. Infection acquired through contact transmission can result in inadvertent autoinoculation from the exposure site to additional sites (including ocular vaccinia) or can result in other adverse reactions.\n",

      "An adverse event noted in temporal association to smallpox vaccination but not demonstrated to be linked etiologically to smallpox vaccination is dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). DCM is a known sequelae of viral myocarditis and can present weeks to months after acute infection (40). Although DCM has not been reported in association with vaccinia vaccination, three DCM cases with symptom onset after smallpox vaccination were identified among DHHS vaccinees (12,41,42). The causal relation between smallpox vaccination and these cases of DCM is unclear. However, because vac-cinia might induce myo/pericarditis and DCM is a rare but recognized outcome of viral myocarditis, an etiologic association between the occurrence of DCM after smallpox vaccination is biologically plausible. The case definition for DCM should be used for surveillance in the context of smallpox preparedness programs (Box 11).\n",
      "Eczema vaccinatum (EV) is a localized or generalized papular, vesicular, pustular, or erosive rash syndrome that can occur anywhere on the body, with a predilection for areas currently or previously affected by atopic dermatitis lesions. Persons with a history of atopic dermatitis are at highest risk for EV. Onset of the characteristic lesions can be noted either concurrently with or shortly after the development of the local vaccinial lesion in vaccinees. EV cases resulting from secondary transmission usually appear with skin eruptions approximately 5-19 days after the suspected exposure. EV lesions follow the same dermatologic course (progression) as the vaccination site in a vaccinee, and confluent or erosive lesions can occur. The rash is often accompanied by fever and lymphadenopathy, and affected persons are frequently systemically ill. EV tends to be most severe among first-time vaccinees, young children, and unvaccinated close contacts of vaccinees. Before the availability of vaccinia immune globulin (VIG), this condition had a high mortality. Establishing the diagnosis early and treating with VIG is crucial in reducing mortality.\n",

Thus, cases are classified as suspected if they have compatible clinical features but either further investigation is required or investigation of the case did not provide enough supporting evidence for the diagnosis. Cases are classified as probable if they have compatible clinical features and information is supportive of, but not definitive for, the diagnosis. Cases are classified as confirmed if pathognomonic findings or other evidence definitely supporting the diagnosis is docu-mented. In certain instances, confirmation is made on the basis of verification of the presence of vaccinia or of orthopox virus DNA by culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) detection. Confirmation also might be determined on the basis of other evidence in instances in which vaccinia presence is not a pathognomonic feature of the entity under surveillance (e.g., myocarditis or pericarditis, both of which are believed to be an immune-mediated response to vaccination rather than mediated through vaccinia viral infection).\n",

No large-scale study examining the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) of smallpox vaccinees exists; therefore, the significance of the presence or absence of vaccinia neutralizing antibodies or vaccinia virus recovered from the CSF of a vaccinee with CNS findings is not fully understood. Testing for the presence or absence of vaccinia virus cannot confirm or refute a smallpox vaccine-associated etiology for these conditions. Conversely, the inability to recover vaccinia virus from burnt-out lesions from an infant exposed to vaccinia in utero and born with skin lesions com-patible with fetal vaccinia does not mean that intrauterine infection did not occur.

When evaluating a reported adverse event after smallpox vaccination, standard laboratory testing should be conducted to rule out other infections, including viral infections (e.g., herpes zoster, varicella, enteroviruses, and herpes simplex). During an outbreak of other orthopoxviruses (e.g., monkeypox and smallpox), specific testing also should be completed for these viruses.\n",
      "Laboratory testing for vaccinia is still largely a research tool assisting the evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of adverse reactions after smallpox vaccination. Testing is available through the Laboratory Response Network (LRN) (43), which can be accessed through state and local health departments with confirmatory testing at CDC. Diagnostic techniques that can aid in the detection of vaccinia include electron microscopy (EM), viral culture, and PCR (17). Although these tests can identify orthopoxviruses, only certain PCR tests or biologic characterization of viral growth on chick chorioallantoic membrane specifically identifies the presence of vaccinia virus. Positive results for EM, PCR, and viral culture should be interpreted with caution. EM or culture results compatible with orthopox virus and presumed to be vaccinia might be another zoonotic orthopox virus or, in the worst case scenario, variola itself. Experience with vaccinia diagnostics is limited. Molecular contamination resulting in false-positive PCR results can occur. Therefore, use of appropriate controls is essential. PCR techniques, which test for orthopoxvirus nucleic acid presence, at LRN have undergone multicenter validation studies, and these data along with clinical experience with these assays is being compiled to enable the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to review the test reagents and assay for wider diagnostic use (17). Serologic testing of single serum samples for vaccinia is of limited value because it cannot discern existing immunity from recent infection. Testing of paired acute and convalescent sera antibody titers is rarely available during initial assessment of a suspected vaccinia adverse event (17).\n",

These surveillance case definitions might not apply to the international community, which administers non-NYCBOH vaccinia strains and faces different considerations in health-care use and surveillance systems. These case definitions are a component of a dynamic surveillance process. As knowledge and experience increase, they might be modified or improved. Ongoing input from health-care providers and health departments are important for the successful implementation and use of these case definitions. Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is defined by the World Health Organization as a disease of the heart muscle characterized by dilatation and impaired contraction of the left ventricle or both ventricles. It might be idiopathic, familial/genetic, viral, and/or immune, alcoholic/toxic, or associated with recognized cardiovascular disease in which the degree of myocardial dysfunction is not explained by the abnormal loading conditions or the extent of ischemic damage. Histology is nonspecific. Presentation is usually with heart failure, which is often progressive. Arrhythmias, thromboembolism, and sudden death are common and can occur at any stage. Despite full cardiac workup, the etiology of DCM often cannot be determined. Because other viruses are known to cause DCM, the occurrence of DCM after smallpox vaccination is plausible, although not previously described. Because histologic findings of DCM are often nonspecific, endomyocardial biopsy is not likely to confirm an etiologic role for vaccinia but might rule out other known etiologies of DCM (e.g., sarcoidosis and amyloidosis).
